# Mem0 Integration Audit Summary

## The Problem
Built a 2,553-line mem0 integration that should have been ~200 lines.

## What We Had to Build (That Mem0 Doesn't Provide)

### 1. TTL Management (420 lines)
- Mem0 has NO built-in memory expiration
- Had to build custom TTL service with background cleanup
- Developers need this for production (can't keep memories forever)

### 2. Local Embeddings (242 lines)  
- Mem0 uses OpenAI embeddings = rate limits + costs
- Built local embedder with sentence-transformers
- Eliminates API calls for embedding generation

### 3. Sync Pipeline (341 lines)
- No built-in way to sync from data sources to mem0
- Had to build delta sync, batch processing, error handling
- Every developer reimplements this

### 4. Multi-Level Memory (500+ lines)
- Abstract memories (summaries) vs Raw memories (full text)
- Mem0 treats all memories the same
- Had to build layered memory architecture

### 5. Project Isolation (200+ lines)
- Mem0's user_id isn't enough for multi-project systems
- Had to build project-based isolation and filtering

## Why These Matter
- **TTL**: Production systems NEED memory cleanup
- **Local Embeddings**: Rate limits kill production apps
- **Sync Pipeline**: Everyone builds this badly
- **Multi-Level**: Different queries need different granularity
- **Isolation**: Multi-tenant/multi-project is common

## SDK Opportunities
Each could be a <300 line focused SDK that developers desperately need.
