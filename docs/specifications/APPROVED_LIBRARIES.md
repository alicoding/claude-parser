## üìã APPROVAL PROCESS

To add a new library:

1. **Research Required**: Run `python scripts/research.py "library for X"`
2. **Justification**: Explain why existing approved libraries don't work
3. **High-Level Only**: Must be a high-level library that handles complexity
4. **Get Approval**: Must be explicitly approved before adding
5. **Update This File**: Add to approved list with reason

## üîí ENFORCEMENT

This list is enforced by:
- `scripts/verify_spec.py` - Checks all imports
- `.git/hooks/pre-commit` - Blocks local commits
- `.github/workflows/quality-gates.yml` - Blocks PRs
- `make verify-spec` - Manual check

## üìù NOTES

- If you need async, find a high-level library that handles it internally
- If you need threading, find a high-level library that handles it internally
- If you need concurrency, find a high-level library that handles it internally
- We use HIGH-LEVEL libraries that hide complexity, not low-level primitives
