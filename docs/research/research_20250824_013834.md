**Query:** python gitpython pygit2 create in-memory git repository track file changes

**Response:**

To create an **in-memory Git repository** and track file changes in Python, you must use the highest-level library that supports this workflow. Here’s what the search results and library docs reveal:

### 1. Library Support for In-Memory Git Repositories

- **pygit2** and **GitPython** are the two main Python libraries for Git automation.
- **GitPython** does not support in-memory repositories; it always works with repositories on disk[3].
- **pygit2** also requires a filesystem path for repository creation and does not natively support fully in-memory repositories[1][5]. All repository operations (including `init_repository`) expect a path.

### 2. Tracking File Changes

- **GitPython**: Use `commit.stats.files` to list changed files in a commit[2].
- **pygit2**: You can create blobs from memory and manipulate the index, but you still need a repository on disk[5].

### 3. Workarounds and Best Practices

- The **standard approach** is to create a temporary directory (e.g., using Python’s `tempfile` module), initialize the repository there, and perform all operations. This is the closest practical solution to "in-memory" for both libraries.

### 4. Example: pygit2 Minimal Workflow

```python
import tempfile
from pygit2 import init_repository, Signature

# Create a temporary directory for the repo
with tempfile.TemporaryDirectory() as repo_dir:
    repo = init_repository(repo_dir, bare=False)
    # Create a blob (file content in memory)
    blob_id = repo.create_blob(b"hello world")
    # Add to index, commit, etc. (requires more pygit2 code)
```
This approach uses the filesystem, but the repo is ephemeral and cleaned up automatically.

### 5. Example: GitPython Minimal Workflow

```python
import tempfile
from git import Repo

with tempfile.TemporaryDirectory() as repo_dir:
    repo = Repo.init(repo_dir)
    # Create a file, add, commit, etc.
    file_path = f"{repo_dir}/test.txt"
    with open(file_path, "w") as f:
        f.write("hello world")
    repo.index.add(["test.txt"])
    repo.index.commit("Initial commit")
    # List changed files in the latest commit
    commit = repo.head.commit
    print(commit.stats.files)
```
Again, this is not truly in-memory, but is the highest-level, library-first solution available.

---

**Summary:**  
- Neither pygit2 nor GitPython supports true in-memory repositories; both require a filesystem path[1][3][5].
- The recommended, library-first approach is to use a temporary directory for ephemeral, "in-memory-like" repositories.
- Use pygit2 or GitPython APIs to track file changes as shown above.

If you need a specific workflow (e.g., only blobs, no commits, or a custom backend), please clarify your requirements. If you need a pure in-memory Git object database, you may need to look beyond these libraries or use a C library with custom bindings, but this is not supported out-of-the-box by the main Python libraries.
