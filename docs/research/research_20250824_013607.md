**Query:** python event sourcing library JSONL replay

**Response:**

The most widely used and actively maintained Python library for **event sourcing with JSONL replay** is the eventsourcing library (also known as pyeventsourcing)[5]. This library is designed specifically for event sourcing patterns, including storing, replaying, and reconstructing application state from event logs.

**Key points:**
- **eventsourcing** supports reading events from a store (which can be file-based, including JSONL), appending new events, and replaying them to reconstruct aggregate state[3][4][5].
- The library provides high-level abstractions for event stores, repositories, and application objects, minimizing the need for custom code[3][4][5].

**How to use eventsourcing for JSONL replay:**

1. **Install the library:**
   ```bash
   pip install eventsourcing
   ```

2. **Store and replay events:**
   - You can append events to the event store (which can be backed by a file, database, or in-memory store).
   - To replay, simply read the events and reconstruct the aggregate using the repository interface.

   Example (simplified, see docs for full details)[4]:
   ```python
   from eventsourcing.infrastructure.eventsourcedrepository import EventSourcedRepository

   # Assume event_store is set up to use a file or memory backend
   example_repository = EventSourcedRepository(event_store=event_store, mutator=mutate)

   # Append events (could be loaded from a JSONL file)
   for event in received_events:
       event_store.append(event)

   # Retrieve and replay to reconstruct state
   retrieved_entity = example_repository[entity.id]
   ```

3. **JSONL support:**
   - While the library natively supports various backends, if you have events in a JSONL file, you can load them as Python dicts and append them to the event store as shown above[4].
   - The library handles the replay logic internally, so you do not need to write custom replay loops.

**Summary Table:**

| Library           | JSONL Replay Support | High-level API | Docs/Examples |
|-------------------|---------------------|----------------|--------------|
| eventsourcing     | Yes (via event store, can load from JSONL) | Yes           | Extensive[3][4][5] |

**Recommendation:**  
Use the **eventsourcing** library for Python event sourcing with JSONL replay. It provides all necessary abstractions for storing, replaying, and reconstructing state from event logs, and can be easily adapted to work with JSONL files by loading events and appending them to the event store[3][4][5].

If you need a concrete example for your specific JSONL format or have a particular event schema, please provide a sample file or schema for more targeted guidance.
