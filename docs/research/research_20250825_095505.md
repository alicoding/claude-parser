**Query:** Python library rich blessed termcolor colorama console tree display formatting

**Response:**

For **colorful, formatted console output and tree display in Python**, the highest-level and most feature-rich library is **Rich**. Rich provides advanced styling, color, formatting, tables, trees, markdown, and more, all with a simple API and no manual ANSI code handling[3][2][1].

### Why Rich is the best choice

- **Color and Style:** Supports 16.7 million colors (truecolor), bold, italic, underline, and background colors with simple markup or style strings[2][3].
- **Tree Display:** Built-in support for rendering tree structures in the terminal.
- **Tables, Markdown, Syntax Highlighting:** Out-of-the-box support for pretty tables, markdown, and syntax-highlighted code[3].
- **Themes:** Easily define and use custom color themes for consistent styling[2][4].
- **No manual glue:** Handles all terminal quirks and compatibility internally.

### Example: Basic Usage

```python
from rich.console import Console

console = Console()
console.print("Hello, [bold magenta]World[/bold magenta]!", style="on white")
```
This prints "Hello, World!" with "World" in bold magenta on a white background[3][2].

### Example: Tree Display

```python
from rich.console import Console
from rich.tree import Tree

console = Console()
tree = Tree("Root")
tree.add("Branch 1")
tree.add("Branch 2")
console.print(tree)
```
This renders a tree structure in the terminal.

### Comparison to Other Libraries

| Library      | Colors | Formatting | Tree Display | Tables | Markdown | Themes | API Simplicity |
|--------------|--------|------------|--------------|--------|----------|--------|----------------|
| **Rich**     | ✔️     | ✔️         | ✔️           | ✔️     | ✔️       | ✔️     | High           |
| blessed      | ✔️     | Limited    | ❌           | ❌     | ❌       | ❌     | Medium         |
| termcolor    | ✔️     | Limited    | ❌           | ❌     | ❌       | ❌     | Simple         |
| colorama     | ✔️     | Limited    | ❌           | ❌     | ❌       | ❌     | Simple         |

- **blessed, termcolor, and colorama** only provide basic color and style support, with no tree, table, or advanced formatting features.
- **Rich** is the only library in this list that provides all requested features with a high-level, declarative API and minimal glue code[3][2][1].

### Recommendation

**Use Rich for all advanced console formatting, color, and tree display needs.** It is the highest-level, most comprehensive library for this purpose, fully aligned with the LIBRARY_FIRST_RULE.md.

If you need code examples for specific features (tables, markdown, themes), let me know. If you have constraints (e.g., must interoperate with another library), please provide more details.
