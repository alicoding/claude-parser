**Query:** Phase 5: Replace all loops with toolz functions

**Response:**

To replace all loops with **toolz** functions, you must first identify the type of loop operation (map, filter, reduce, groupby, etc.), then use the corresponding high-level toolz function. This approach is required by your LIBRARY_FIRST_RULE.md: use library functions (like those in toolz) instead of writing custom loops.

Before proceeding, please provide:
- Example(s) of the loops you want to replace (code snippets or file paths).
- The specific data structures involved (lists, dicts, custom objects, etc.).
- Any edge cases or performance requirements.

Without this, I can only give a general workflow:

**General Workflow for Replacing Loops with toolz:**

1. **Identify the loop pattern:**
   - Mapping: transforming each element → use `toolz.map` or `toolz.curried.map`
   - Filtering: selecting elements by condition → use `toolz.filter` or `toolz.curried.filter`
   - Reducing: aggregating to a single value → use `toolz.reduce`
   - Grouping: grouping by key → use `toolz.groupby`
   - Flattening: flattening nested iterables → use `toolz.concat`, `toolz.concatv`, or `toolz.itertoolz.flatten`

2. **Replace the loop with the toolz function:**
   - For mapping:
     ```python
     from toolz import map
     result = list(map(lambda x: x * 2, data))
     ```
   - For filtering:
     ```python
     from toolz import filter
     result = list(filter(lambda x: x > 0, data))
     ```
   - For reducing:
     ```python
     from toolz import reduce
     result = reduce(lambda acc, x: acc + x, data, 0)
     ```
   - For grouping:
     ```python
     from toolz import groupby
     result = groupby(lambda x: x['category'], data)
     ```
   - For flattening:
     ```python
     from toolz.itertoolz import concat
     result = list(concat(list_of_lists))
     ```

3. **Remove all explicit for/while loops** and replace with the above.

**Important notes:**
- Do not use list comprehensions or generator expressions if the rule is "toolz only."
- If you encounter a loop pattern not covered by toolz, document it and provide evidence (PyPI, GitHub, Stack Overflow) that toolz does not support it.

**Next steps:**
- Please paste a representative loop or describe your use case in detail.
- If you have a codebase, specify file paths or function names.

This will allow me to recommend the exact toolz function and show the minimal glue code required, as mandated by your quality standards.
