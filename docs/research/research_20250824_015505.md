**Query:** python machine learning pattern recognition coding style detection clustering

**Response:**

To detect **coding style patterns** in Python using machine learning and clustering, you should use high-level libraries that handle feature extraction, clustering, and code analysis, minimizing custom code per the LIBRARY_FIRST_RULE.md.

Before proceeding, please clarify:
- Are you trying to cluster code snippets by **style** (e.g., PEP8 compliance, variable naming, formatting)?
- Do you have a dataset of code samples, or do you need to extract them from a codebase?
- What is your end goal: visualization, automated style enforcement, or something else?
- Do you want to detect "code smells" (anti-patterns) or just stylistic similarity?

Assuming you want to cluster Python code samples by **coding style** (not just code smells or quality), here’s the library-first approach:

---

## 1. Feature Extraction from Python Code

Use **Radon** or **Pyanalyze** to extract code metrics and style features (e.g., cyclomatic complexity, line length, naming conventions). These tools provide programmatic APIs for extracting features relevant to style and structure[1].

- **Radon**: Extracts metrics like cyclomatic complexity, raw metrics, maintainability index.
- **Pyanalyze**: Static analysis for code style and type issues.

Example (Radon):

```python
from radon.complexity import cc_visit
from radon.metrics import mi_visit, h_visit

code = '''
def foo(x):
    if x > 0:
        return x
    else:
        return -x
'''

# Cyclomatic complexity
cc = cc_visit(code)
# Maintainability index
mi = mi_visit(code, True)
# Halstead metrics
h = h_visit(code)
```

## 2. Vectorization

Convert extracted metrics into feature vectors for clustering. Use **pandas** for tabular data manipulation.

## 3. Clustering

Use **scikit-learn** for clustering algorithms (e.g., KMeans, MeanShift, AgglomerativeClustering)[2][4].

Example (KMeans):

```python
from sklearn.cluster import KMeans
import numpy as np

# X: your feature matrix from code metrics
kmeans = KMeans(n_clusters=3, random_state=42)
labels = kmeans.fit_predict(X)
```

## 4. Visualization (Optional)

Use **matplotlib** or **seaborn** to visualize clusters.

| Step                | Library (Use This)      | Purpose                                 |
|---------------------|------------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| Feature Extraction  | radon, pyanalyze       | Extract code metrics/style features     |
| Data Handling       | pandas                 | Organize features into vectors          |
| Clustering          | scikit-learn           | Cluster code samples by style           |
| Visualization       | matplotlib, seaborn    | Visualize clusters                      |

**Do not** write custom parsers or clustering code—these libraries cover 95%+ of the workflow. If you need to detect specific "code smells" (e.g., Large Class, Long Method), use the Radon API and label accordingly[1].

If you clarify your dataset and target style features, I can provide a minimal, library-first code example tailored to your use case.
