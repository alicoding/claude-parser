**Query:** python library event store projection rebuild state from events

**Response:**

To rebuild projection state from events in Python, the highest-level library is **eventsourcing** (PyPI: eventsourcing), which provides comprehensive support for event stores, projections, and replaying events to rebuild state[2]. This library is specifically designed for event sourcing patterns, allowing you to derive current state from an event stream and rebuild projections as needed.

**Recommended Library:**  
- **eventsourcing** (PyPI: eventsourcing)

**Key Features:**
- Stores all changes as a sequence of events.
- Supports building and rebuilding projections from event streams.
- Provides APIs for replaying events to reconstruct aggregate or projection state[2].
- Handles consistency, performance, and developer experience.

**Example Usage:**
```python
from eventsourcing.domain import Aggregate, event
from eventsourcing.application import Application

class User(Aggregate):
    @event('Registered')
    def register(self, name):
        self.name = name

app = Application()
user = User.register(name="Alice")
app.save(user)

# Rebuild projection by replaying events
events = app.event_store.iter_events(user.id)
state = None
for event in events:
    state = User.mutate(state, event)
print(state.name)  # "Alice"
```
This example shows how to replay events to rebuild the aggregate's state, which is the basis for projections[2].

**Projection Rebuild Workflow:**
- Create a new projection table or model.
- Replay all events for each aggregate to compute the new state.
- Save the rebuilt state to the new projection[1].

**Alternative Libraries:**
- **quintans/eventsourcing** (GitHub) also supports projections and rebuilding them by replaying events, but is less widely adopted than eventsourcing[1].

**Summary Table:**

| Library         | Projection Rebuild Support | API Level | Notes                        |
|-----------------|---------------------------|-----------|------------------------------|
| eventsourcing   | Yes                       | High      | Most popular, well-documented|
| quintans/eventsourcing | Yes                | Medium    | Migration features planned   |

**Next Steps:**  
If you need a specific example for your domain, or integration with a particular database or framework, please provide more details (e.g., event schema, projection type, database backend). This will help tailor the solution and ensure strict adherence to the LIBRARY_FIRST_RULE.md.
