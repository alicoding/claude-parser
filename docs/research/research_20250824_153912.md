**Query:** best python libraries for functional filtering and collection operations funcy vs toolz vs more-itertools comparison

**Response:**

For **functional filtering and collection operations in Python**, the three most prominent libraries are **funcy**, **toolz**, and **more-itertools**. Each offers a different approach and feature set:

| Library           | Focus & Style                                      | Key Features & Strengths                                                                 | Typical Use Cases                                  |
|-------------------|----------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|
| **funcy**         | Functional utilities, concise syntax, chaining     | map/filter/reduce, select, group_by, walk, partials, decorators, data manipulation       | Declarative, chainable data transformations        |
| **toolz**         | Functional standard library, composability         | map/filter/reduce, groupby, countby, partition, compose, curry, high composability       | Data pipelines, functional composition, grouping   |
| **more-itertools**| Iterable recipes, extending itertools              | chunked, grouper, unique_everseen, windowed, batched, set operations, advanced batching  | Advanced iteration, batching, windowing, grouping  |

### Essential Context and Supporting Details

- **funcy** is designed for *concise, chainable functional programming* in Python. It provides a wide range of utilities for filtering, mapping, grouping, and transforming collections, with a focus on readability and expressiveness. Its API is inspired by functional languages and supports both lazy and eager evaluation[4].

- **toolz** offers a *comprehensive functional toolkit* with a focus on composability and performance. It includes advanced collection operations (e.g., groupby, countby, partition), function composition, currying, and utilities for working with iterables and dictionaries. Toolz is widely used in data science and ETL pipelines for its ability to build complex data flows from simple, reusable functions[2][3][4].

- **more-itertools** extends Python's built-in itertools with *practical recipes* for working with iterables. It excels at batching, grouping, windowing, and filtering operations that go beyond the standard library. Its functions are highly composable and work with any iterable, making it ideal for advanced iteration patterns and memory-efficient processing[1][5].

### Additional Relevant Information

- **Popularity & Ecosystem**: All three libraries are well-maintained and widely used, with funcy and toolz being especially popular in the functional programming community, and more-itertools being a go-to for iterable manipulation[4].
- **API Style**:
  - funcy: Emphasizes *chainable* and *declarative* syntax.
  - toolz: Focuses on *composability* and *functional purity*.
  - more-itertools: Prioritizes *practicality* and *extending* the standard library.
- **Performance**: toolz is often chosen for high-performance data pipelines due to its efficient implementation and lazy evaluation.
- **Learning Curve**: funcy and toolz may require familiarity with functional programming concepts; more-itertools is approachable for those already using itertools.

### Summary Table

| Feature/Library      | funcy                | toolz                | more-itertools         |
|----------------------|----------------------|----------------------|------------------------|
| Filtering            | Yes                  | Yes                  | Yes                    |
| Grouping             | Yes (group_by)       | Yes (groupby, countby)| Yes (grouper, chunked) |
| Batching/Chunking    | Yes                  | Yes (partition)      | Yes (batched, chunked) |
| Function Composition | Yes                  | Yes (compose, curry) | No                     |
| Chainable API        | Yes                  | Yes                  | No                     |
| Extends itertools    | No                   | No                   | Yes                    |
| Declarative Syntax   | Yes                  | Somewhat             | No                     |

**Recommendation**:  
- Use **funcy** for concise, chainable, and expressive functional transformations.
- Use **toolz** for building composable, high-performance data pipelines with advanced grouping and functional utilities.
- Use **more-itertools** when you need advanced iterable manipulation, batching, or recipes not found in itertools.

All three libraries can be used together, but per the LIBRARY_FIRST_RULE.md, always prefer the highest-level library that covers your use case before writing custom code[4].
