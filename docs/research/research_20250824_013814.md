**Query:** python memento pattern library undo redo state history

**Response:**

There is no widely adopted, high-level Python library that provides a full-featured **Memento pattern** implementation with built-in **undo/redo and state history** management out of the box. Most Python solutions for undo/redo and state history are implemented manually using the Memento pattern, as described in design pattern tutorials and articles[1][3][5]. 

**Key points:**
- The Memento pattern is commonly used for undo/redo by capturing and restoring object state snapshots[1][3][5].
- Most Python codebases implement this pattern themselves, typically with three classes: **Originator** (the object whose state is saved), **Memento** (the snapshot), and **Caretaker** (manages the history stack)[1][3][5].
- There is no standard, pip-installable library that abstracts this pattern for arbitrary Python objects.

**What you should do:**
- If you want undo/redo and state history for your Python objects, you will likely need to implement the Memento pattern yourself, using the standard approach:
    - Store snapshots of state in a history stack (for undo) and a future stack (for redo)[1][4].
    - Use serialization (e.g., with orjson) for deep copies if needed[3].
- If you are working with a specific framework (e.g., GUI, data science, etc.), there may be framework-specific solutions. Please specify your use case for more targeted recommendations.

**Example of manual implementation (from GeeksforGeeks):**
```python
class Memento:
    def __init__(self, state):
        self._state = state

    def get_state(self):
        return self._state

class Originator:
    def __init__(self, text):
        self.text = text

    def set_text(self, text):
        self.text = text

    def create_memento(self):
        return Memento(self.text)

    def restore_memento(self, memento):
        self.text = memento.get_state()
```
This is then managed by a caretaker that keeps the undo/redo stacks[1].

**If you need a library:**
- Please clarify your use case (e.g., GUI, data models, specific frameworks).
- If you want a generic, reusable undo/redo state history manager for arbitrary Python objects, there is currently no high-level library that does this for you. You will need to implement the pattern as above, using orjson for serialization if deep copies are needed.

Would you like a ready-to-use code template for this pattern, or are you looking for a library for a specific framework or domain? Please provide more details about your context or requirements.
