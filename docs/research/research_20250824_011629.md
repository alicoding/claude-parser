**Query:** python memento pattern snapshot undo redo history library pickle dill

**Response:**

There is no widely adopted, high-level Python library that provides a full-featured **Memento pattern** implementation with **snapshot, undo/redo history**, and **serialization** (via pickle or dill) out of the box. Most available solutions are custom implementations or basic design pattern examples, not robust libraries[1][3][4][5].

**Key points:**

- The Memento pattern is commonly implemented manually in Python, with the Originator, Memento, and Caretaker roles clearly defined[1][3][4][5].
- **Serialization** (using pickle or dill) is often used to capture deep snapshots of object state, but this is typically done directly, not via a dedicated memento/undo library[3][2].
- There is no evidence of a mature, pip-installable library that combines all of: memento pattern, undo/redo history, and pluggable serialization (pickle/dill) as a single package.

**Recommended approach (per LIBRARY_FIRST_RULE.md):**

1. **For undo/redo history and state snapshots:**
   - Use a general-purpose **state management** or **history tracking** library if available.
   - No such high-level library is found in the search results.

2. **For serialization:**
   - Use **dill** for advanced serialization (supports more Python objects than pickle)[2].
   - Use **pickle** for standard serialization.

3. **For design pattern structure:**
   - Implement the Memento pattern using standard Python classes, as shown in the examples[1][3][4][5].

**If you need a library that provides:**
- **Undo/redo history** for arbitrary Python objects
- **Snapshotting** with serialization (pickle/dill)
- **Memento pattern abstraction

Please clarify:**
- What is the type of object/state you want to snapshot?
- Do you require thread safety, persistence to disk, or just in-memory history?
- Are you looking for integration with a specific framework (e.g., GUI, data science, etc.)?

**If you want a code example using dill for snapshots in a Memento pattern, or want help searching PyPI/GitHub for any new libraries, please provide more details about your use case and requirements.**
