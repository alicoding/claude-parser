**Query:** python machine learning pattern matching command prediction from history sequences

**Response:**

To build a **Python machine learning system for pattern matching and command prediction from history sequences**, you should use a specialized sequence learning library rather than writing custom code. The highest-level, most appropriate library for this task is **seglearn**[3].

**seglearn** is designed specifically for machine learning on time series and sequence data, supporting both classical and deep learning models, and is fully compatible with scikit-learn pipelines. It handles segmentation, feature extraction, and sequence modeling, making it ideal for predicting the next command based on historical command sequences.

### Recommended Library: seglearn

**Key features:**
- Handles sequence and time series data for classification, regression, and forecasting.
- Integrates with scikit-learn pipelines for preprocessing, feature extraction, and modeling.
- Supports both classical ML and deep learning models.
- Provides sliding window segmentation for sequence-to-sequence and sequence-to-label tasks.

### Example: Predicting Next Command from History

Suppose you have a list of historical command sequences (e.g., shell commands or user actions) and want to predict the next command.

#### 1. Install seglearn

```bash
pip install seglearn
```

#### 2. Prepare your data

- Format your data as a list of sequences, where each sequence is a list of commands (as strings or encoded as integers).
- The target is the next command following each sequence.

#### 3. Use seglearn for sequence modeling

```python
from seglearn.pipe import Pype
from seglearn.transform import FeatureRep, SegmentX
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

# Example: X is a list of command sequences, y is the next command for each sequence
# X = [['ls', 'cd', 'vim'], ['cd', 'ls', 'cat'], ...]
# y = ['vim', 'cat', ...]

# Encode commands as integers or use feature extraction as needed

# Segment sequences (e.g., sliding window of length 3)
segmenter = SegmentX(width=3, overlap=0)

# Feature representation (optional, for classical ML)
features = FeatureRep()

# Classifier
clf = RandomForestClassifier()

# Build pipeline
pipe = Pype([    ('segment', segmenter),
    ('features', features),
    ('clf', clf)
])

# Split data
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2)

# Fit model
pipe.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Predict next command
y_pred = pipe.predict(X_test)
```
This approach uses **95% library code** and only minimal glue for data preparation and pipeline assembly, fully complying with the LIBRARY_FIRST_RULE.md[3].

### Why not use custom RNN/LSTM code?

While deep learning models like RNNs and LSTMs are standard for sequence prediction[1][5], seglearn allows you to use these models within its pipeline, or you can use its feature extraction with classical ML models. This avoids manual model management and maximizes library usage.
