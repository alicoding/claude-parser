**Query:** event sourcing CQRS python library event store projection replay

**Response:**

For implementing **event sourcing** and **CQRS** in Python with support for an **event store**, **projections**, and **event replay**, the most established and feature-complete library is the eventsourcing library[3]. There are also other options with varying levels of maturity and focus.

### Recommended Library

**eventsourcing**  
- A comprehensive Python library for event sourcing, supporting event stores, projections, and replaying events into projections[3].
- Install with:  
  ```bash
  pip install eventsourcing
  ```
- Features:
  - Event store abstraction (supports multiple backends)
  - Projections (read models built from event streams)
  - Event replay (rebuild projections from the event log)
  - Snapshots, versioning, and more

**Example: Basic Usage**
```python
from eventsourcing.domain import Aggregate, event
from eventsourcing.application import Application

class MyAggregate(Aggregate):
    @event('SomethingHappened')
    def do_something(self, data):
        self.data = data

app = Application()
agg = MyAggregate()
agg.do_something('hello')
app.save(agg)

# Replaying events to rebuild state or projections
for event in app.event_store.iter_events(agg.id):
    print(event)
```
See the official documentation for advanced projection and replay patterns[3].

### Other Notable Libraries

| Library | Event Store | Projections | Replay | Notes |
|---------|-------------|-------------|--------|-------|
| **eventsourcing**[3] | Yes | Yes | Yes | Most mature, production-ready |
| **quintans/eventsourcing**[2] | Yes (MySQL, PostgreSQL, Mongo) | Yes | Yes | Explicit support for projection replay, event bus integration |
| **aliseylaneh/Python-Eventsourcing-CQRS**[1] | Yes | Yes | Not explicit | DDD, CQRS, FastAPI-based, less mature |
| **Diator**[5] | No (CQRS only) | No | No | CQRS abstraction, not event sourcing |

- **quintans/eventsourcing** provides explicit support for event store, projections, and replay, with database and event bus integrations[2].
- **aliseylaneh/Python-Eventsourcing-CQRS** is a FastAPI-based DDD/CQRS/event sourcing example, but less mature and not as feature-rich as eventsourcing[1].
- **Diator** is a CQRS library, but does not provide event sourcing or event store functionality[5].

---

### Projection Replay

Both **eventsourcing**[3] and **quintans/eventsourcing**[2] support **replaying events** to rebuild projections:
- In eventsourcing, you can iterate over the event store and rebuild your read models.
- In quintans/eventsourcing, projection replay is a first-class feature, and you can rebuild projections from the beginning of the event log[2].

---

**Summary:**  
For production-grade event sourcing and CQRS with event store, projections, and replay in Python, use the **eventsourcing** library[3]. If you need explicit event bus integration or want to explore alternatives, consider **quintans/eventsourcing**[2]. For CQRS only (without event sourcing), Diator is an option[5].
