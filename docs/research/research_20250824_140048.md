**Query:** Python library for automatic DRY violation detection duplicate code detection similar functions

**Response:**

For **automatic DRY violation and duplicate code detection in Python**, the highest-level, most widely used libraries are:

- **SonarQube** (with Python plugin)
- **PMD's Copy/Paste Detector (CPD)**
- **IntelliJ IDEA's Duplicate Code Detection** (if using the IDE)

These tools are specifically designed to detect **duplicate code, similar functions, and DRY violations** in Python and other languages.

### Recommended Libraries/Tools

| Tool/Library                | Python Support | How It Works                        | Usage Level         |
|-----------------------------|---------------|-------------------------------------|---------------------|
| **SonarQube**               | Yes           | Scans for code duplication, DRY, and many other code quality issues. Integrates with CI/CD. | Enterprise/Team     |
| **PMD CPD**                 | Yes           | Detects copy-paste/duplicate code via CLI or plugins. Supports Python. | CLI/Automation      |
| **IntelliJ IDEA**           | Yes           | Real-time and manual duplicate detection in IDE. | Developer/IDE       |

---

### Details & Usage

- **SonarQube**  
  - Scans Python code for **duplicate code blocks, similar functions, and DRY violations** as part of its static analysis[5].
  - Provides detailed reports and integrates with CI/CD pipelines.
  - Requires setup of a SonarQube server and Python plugin.

- **PMD CPD (Copy/Paste Detector)**
  - Command-line tool that detects **duplicate code** in Python and many other languages[4].
  - Example usage:
    ```bash
    # Install PMD (Java required), then run:
    run.sh cpd --minimum-tokens 50 --files /path/to/python/code --language python
    ```
  - Outputs a report of duplicate code blocks.

- **IntelliJ IDEA Duplicate Code Detection**
  - If you use IntelliJ IDEA (Ultimate), it provides **real-time and manual duplicate code detection** for Python[2].
  - Highlights duplicates as you type or on demand.
  - Suggests refactoring options directly in the IDE.

---

### Other Mentions

- **PyCharm** (by JetBrains, similar to IntelliJ) also has duplicate code detection for Python.
- **SonarCloud** (cloud version of SonarQube) offers similar features for open-source projects.

---

**No need to write custom code** for DRY/duplicate detection—these tools are mature, widely used, and integrate easily into Python workflows.  
If you need **CLI-only, open-source, and Python-specific**, start with **PMD CPD**.  
For **enterprise/CI/CD integration**, use **SonarQube**.

Would you like a step-by-step example for integrating one of these tools into your workflow? If so, please specify your environment (CLI, IDE, CI/CD, etc.) and any constraints.

**Query:** Python library pylint flake8 vulture radon clone detection duplicate code detector pip install

**Response:**

**None of the following libraries—**pylint, flake8, vulture, radon**—detect duplicate code or clone functions out-of-the-box.** They are static analysis tools focused on style, errors, complexity, and dead code, but **do not perform clone detection or DRY violation analysis**[3][5][2][4][1].

---

### What Each Tool Does

- **pylint**: Checks for syntax errors, style violations, unused variables/imports, and code smells. No duplicate code detection[5][3].
- **flake8**: Bundles Pyflakes, pycodestyle, and mccabe for style, error, and complexity checks. No clone detection[2][3].
- **vulture**: Finds unused code (dead code), not duplicates[3][4].
- **radon**: Measures code complexity and maintainability, not duplication[3][4].
- **Pylama/Prospector**: Aggregate multiple linters, but do not add clone detection[3][4].

---

### For **Duplicate Code / Clone Detection** in Python

You need a **dedicated clone detection tool**. The most common and pip-installable options are:

- **jscpd** (JavaScript Copy/Paste Detector, supports Python)
    - Install:  
      ```bash
      pip install jscpd
      ```
    - Usage:  
      ```bash
      jscpd --languages python --path ./your_project
      ```
    - Detects **duplicate code blocks, similar functions, and copy-paste violations**.

- **PMD CPD** (Copy/Paste Detector, Java-based but supports Python)
    - Not pip-installable; requires Java.
    - CLI usage for Python projects.

- **SonarQube/SonarCloud**: Enterprise-grade, not pip-installable, but supports Python and clone detection.

### Summary Table

| Tool      | pip install | Duplicate/Clone Detection | Main Purpose                |
|-----------|-------------|--------------------------|-----------------------------|
| pylint    | Yes         | No                       | Style, errors, code smells  |
| flake8    | Yes         | No                       | Style, errors, complexity   |
| vulture   | Yes         | No                       | Dead code                   |
| radon     | Yes         | No                       | Complexity, maintainability |
| **jscpd** | Yes         | **Yes**                  | **Duplicate code detection**|
| PMD CPD   | No          | Yes                      | Duplicate code detection    |

---

**Recommendation:**  
For **automatic DRY violation and duplicate code detection in Python**, use **jscpd**—it is pip-installable, CLI-friendly, and specifically designed for this purpose.

Would you like a sample configuration or usage example for jscpd?
