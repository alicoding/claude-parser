**Query:** python library for time travel debugging replay state at any point

**Response:**

The highest-level Python library for **time travel debugging**—allowing you to replay and inspect program state at any point—is the package **time-travel-debugger**[5]. This library enables step-backward debugging, making it possible to visually and interactively move through your program’s execution history.

Key points:
- **time-travel-debugger** is a Python library specifically designed for time-travel debugging, supporting replay and inspection of previous program states[5].
- It provides a visual and interactive debugging experience, allowing you to step backward through execution, not just forward as with traditional debuggers[5].

Other approaches and projects:
- There are research and experimental projects such as "Python Rewind" and "timenav" that attempt to implement time-travel debugging by recording program state and allowing navigation through execution history, but these are not mainstream or production-ready libraries[3].
- Some advanced debuggers and platforms (e.g., rr, Undo, Temporal) implement record & replay or snapshotting for time-travel debugging, but these are not Python-specific libraries and often require custom runtimes or integrations[1].

**Recommendation:**  
Use the **time-travel-debugger** library from PyPI for Python projects requiring time-travel debugging and replay of state at any point[5].

Example usage (based on standard Python debugging patterns; consult the library’s documentation for specifics):

```python
import time_travel_debugger

def buggy_function():
    x = 1
    y = 2
    z = x + y
    print(z)

time_travel_debugger.start()
buggy_function()
time_travel_debugger.stop()
# Now use the debugger's UI or API to step backward/forward through execution
```

If you need a specific feature (e.g., integration with a particular IDE, support for async code, or database state replay), please provide more details so I can recommend the most suitable library or tool.
