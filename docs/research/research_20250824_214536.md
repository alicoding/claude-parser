**Query:** Python task management libraries workflow automation dstask git integration

**Response:**

For **Python-based task management and workflow automation with git integration**, the highest-level libraries and tools are:

- **dstask**: A terminal-based, git-powered personal task manager with markdown notes and checklist support. It is not a Python library but a standalone tool written in Go, designed for personal use and integrates directly with git for synchronization[2]. It does not provide a Python API or workflow automation features, but you can use it alongside Python scripts by invoking its CLI commands.

- **Workflow orchestration libraries**:
    - **Apache Airflow**: A robust, Python-based platform for authoring, scheduling, and monitoring workflows. Airflow supports custom plugins and can be extended to interact with git (for example, to pull DAGs or tasks from a git repository), but it is not a task manager in the sense of personal to-do lists[3].
    - **Luigi**: Another Python workflow tool, focused on batch jobs and dependency management. Like Airflow, it is not a personal task manager but can automate complex workflows and could be integrated with git for code or data versioning[3].

- **GitHub Actions**: For workflow automation tied to git repositories, GitHub Actions is the standard. You can automate Python tasks (linting, testing, deployment, etc.) triggered by git events. Actions are defined in YAML, but you can run Python scripts as part of these workflows[4].

Comparison Table

| Tool/Library      | Type                | Git Integration | Python API | Workflow Automation | Personal Task Mgmt | Notes/Checklist Support |
|-------------------|---------------------|-----------------|------------|---------------------|--------------------|------------------------|
| dstask            | CLI tool            | Yes (native)    | No         | No                  | Yes                | Yes (markdown)         |
| Apache Airflow    | Workflow orchestrator| Indirect (via plugins/scripts) | Yes | Yes | No | No |
| Luigi             | Workflow orchestrator| Indirect (via plugins/scripts) | Yes | Yes | No | No |
| GitHub Actions    | CI/CD platform      | Yes (native)    | No (YAML, but runs Python) | Yes | No | No |

**Key recommendations:**
- For **personal task management with git sync and markdown notes**, use **dstask**[2].
- For **Python workflow automation** (e.g., data pipelines, batch jobs), use **Apache Airflow** or **Luigi**[3].
- For **automating Python tasks in response to git events**, use **GitHub Actions**[4].

If you need a **Python library** that combines all of these (task management, workflow automation, and git integration), there is currently no single library that does everything out-of-the-box. The best practice is to use the highest-level tool for each part and glue them together minimally, per your requirements.

To provide a more targeted recommendation or example, please clarify:
- Are you looking for a Python API for personal task management with git sync?
- Do you need workflow automation for data pipelines, CI/CD, or something else?
- Is integration with dstask (the CLI tool) required, or are you open to other solutions?
- Do you need collaborative features, or is this strictly for personal use?
- Any specific file paths, error messages, or integration points you want to automate?

**Query:** Python subprocess wrapper libraries shell command execution process management

**Response:**

The highest-level **Python subprocess wrapper library** for shell command execution and process management is **subprocrunner**[3]. It wraps the standard library's `subprocess` module, providing a simpler API for running commands, handling retries, dry runs, command history, and integrates with **loguru** for logging if installed[3]. This approach is strongly preferred over writing custom wrappers or using low-level `subprocess` code, per your strict library-first workflow.

**Recommended Library:**  
- **subprocrunner** (PyPI: `subprocrunner`)

**Key Features:**
- Simple command execution: `SubprocessRunner("ls -l").run()`
- Automatic retries for failed commands
- Exception handling for failed executions
- Dry-run support
- Command execution history
- Optional logging via loguru[3]

**Example Usage:**
```python
from subprocrunner import SubprocessRunner

runner = SubprocessRunner("ls -l")
return_code = runner.run()
print(runner.stdout)  # Output of the command
print(runner.stderr)  # Error output, if any
```
- For logging, install loguru: `pip install loguru` and subprocrunner will use it automatically[3].

**Installation:**
```bash
pip install subprocrunner
```

**Why not use the standard library directly?**
- The standard library's `subprocess` module (`run`, `Popen`, etc.) is lower-level and requires more boilerplate for retries, logging, and error handling[2][4][5].
- subprocrunner abstracts these patterns, minimizing custom code and maximizing reliability per your workflow requirements.

**Other notable libraries:**
- **asyncio.subprocess**: For asynchronous subprocess management, use the built-in `asyncio.create_subprocess_exec` or `asyncio.create_subprocess_shell`[1]. However, this is still lower-level than subprocrunner and requires manual async code.
- **sh**: Another wrapper for subprocess, but less focused on process management and retries than subprocrunner.

**Next Steps:**
- Use **subprocrunner** for all synchronous shell command execution and process management.
- If you need async support, clarify your requirementsâ€”there is no high-level async subprocess wrapper that matches subprocrunner's features, but you can use `asyncio.subprocess`[1].

If you need batch processing, retries, or scheduling, combine subprocrunner with **more-itertools** (for batching), **tenacity** (for advanced retry logic), or **apscheduler** (for scheduling), but always prefer the highest-level library first.

**Please specify:**
- Do you need async subprocess management?
- Are there specific process management features (e.g., timeout, resource limits, environment control) you require?
- Any integration with logging, batch, or scheduling libraries needed?

This will ensure the solution is 95% library code, 5% glue, per your strict standards.
