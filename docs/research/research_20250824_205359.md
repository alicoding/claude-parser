**Query:** Phase 3: Merge 3 analyzer services into UnifiedAnalyzer

**Response:**

To merge 3 analyzer services into a **UnifiedAnalyzer**, you should first identify if there is a high-level library or framework that can orchestrate and unify multiple analysis pipelines or services. Before proceeding, I need more context to ensure strict adherence to the LIBRARY_FIRST_RULE:

- What are the names and types of the 3 analyzer services? (e.g., are they Python classes, microservices, REST APIs, CLI tools, etc.?)
- What programming language and framework are you using for the UnifiedAnalyzer?
- What is the expected interface or output of UnifiedAnalyzer? (e.g., single API endpoint, combined report, etc.)
- Are the analyzers synchronous or asynchronous? Do they require scheduling, batching, or event-driven orchestration?
- Are there any specific requirements for error handling, retries, or data validation?
- Do you need to merge results, chain outputs, or run all analyzers in parallel?

Please provide these details so I can recommend the highest-level library that will handle the merging with minimal custom code, in line with your strict quality standards.
