**Query:** MASTER CLEANUP: Fix 12 files over 150 LOC and achieve 100% compliance

**Response:**

To achieve 100% compliance for a "MASTER CLEANUP" of 12 files over 150 LOC each, you must use the highest-level, library-driven tools for code cleanup, formatting, linting, and static analysisâ€”manual or custom scripts are not allowed per the LIBRARY_FIRST_RULE.md. Before proceeding, I need clarification on:

- What language(s) are these files written in? (e.g., Python, JavaScript, Java, etc.)
- What is your current definition of "compliance"? (e.g., PEP8 for Python, ESLint rules for JS, custom company rules, etc.)
- Are there any specific frameworks or tech stacks involved?
- Do you have existing config files (e.g., .prettierrc, .eslintrc, pyproject.toml)?
- Are there any files or patterns to exclude from cleanup?
- Is this a one-time cleanup or should it be automated for CI/CD?

Please provide this context so I can recommend the most appropriate, library-first solution and example workflow. 

If you have sample file paths or error messages from previous attempts, please share them as well.
