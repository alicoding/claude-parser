**Query:** Phase 1: Consolidate 3 Stats classes into UnifiedStats

**Response:**

To consolidate 3 Stats classes into a single UnifiedStats class, you must first clarify several critical details to ensure the solution is library-first, minimal in custom code, and meets your codebaseâ€™s standards:

**Please provide:**
- The names and file paths of the 3 Stats classes you want to consolidate.
- The programming language and framework (e.g., Python, Django, etc.).
- The main attributes and methods of each Stats class (or the code itself).
- Any existing dependencies or libraries already in use for statistics or data modeling.
- The desired interface and requirements for UnifiedStats (e.g., should it be a dataclass, support serialization, etc.).
- Any constraints (e.g., must be compatible with pydantic, must support batch operations, etc.).

**Why this is necessary:**  
Without this context, I cannot determine which high-level library (e.g., pydantic, attrs, dataclasses, marshmallow, or a statistics/dataframe library like pandas or polars) is best suited for consolidation, nor can I ensure compliance with your strict library-first rule.

**Next steps:**  
Please reply with:
- The code or a summary of the three Stats classes.
- Any sample usage or tests.
- Any specific requirements for UnifiedStats.

Once you provide this, I will:
1. Identify the highest-level library that can unify the classes with minimal glue code.
2. Provide a library-based consolidation approach with code examples.
3. Ensure the solution is 95% library, 5% glue, per your requirements.
