**Query:** python library git-like branching versioning for JSON data structures

**Response:**

The highest-level Python library for **Git-like branching and versioning of JSON data structures** is not a single, widely-adopted package, but several tools and approaches exist that partially address this need. For strict adherence to the LIBRARY_FIRST_RULE, here are the best options based on current search results:

- **lakeFS** is an open-source system providing Git-like branching and versioning for data lakes, including JSON files, but it is designed for large-scale data and works outside Python as a service layer[4].
- **jsonmerge** supports versioned merging of JSON documents, allowing you to keep a versioned list of changes, but does not provide full Git-like branching (e.g., branching, merging, rebasing) semantics[1].
- **No Python library found that natively provides full Git-like branching/versioning for in-memory JSON structures.**

### Details

#### 1. **lakeFS**
- **Purpose:** Git-like branching/versioning for data lakes (files, including JSON).
- **Workflow:** You interact with lakeFS via its API or CLI, not as a pure Python library. It is ideal for large datasets, not for in-memory Python objects[4].
- **Use Case:** If your JSON data is stored as files and you want to branch, merge, and version them like Git, lakeFS is the highest-level solution.

#### 2. **jsonmerge**
- **Purpose:** Merging and versioning JSON documents.
- **Features:** Supports versioned merges, keeping a history of revisions within the JSON structure.
- **Limitations:** Does not support branching, merging branches, or rebasing like Git. It is focused on merging and versioning, not full VCS semantics[1].
- **Example:**
  ```python
  from jsonmerge import Merger

  schema = {
      "properties": {
          "foo": {
              "type": "object",
              "mergeStrategy": "version",
              "mergeOptions": {"limit": 5}
          }
      },
      "additionalProperties": False
  }
  merger = Merger(schema)
  rev1 = {'foo': {'greeting': 'Hello, World!'}}
  rev2 = {'foo': {'greeting': 'Howdy, World!'}}
  base = None
  base = merger.merge(base, rev1, merge_options={'version': {'metadata': {'revision': 1}}})
  base = merger.merge(base, rev2, merge_options={'version': {'metadata': {'revision': 2}}})
  # base now contains a versioned list of changes
  ```
- **Best Fit:** If you only need versioned merges, not full branching.

#### 3. **Other Approaches**
- **No direct Python library** found for in-memory Git-like branching/versioning of JSON structures.
- Some developers have built custom layers to serialize database records to JSON files and use Git for versioning and branching, but these are not open-source libraries and require significant custom code[2].

### Next Steps

- If your data is **file-based** and you want Git-like semantics, use **lakeFS**[4].
- If you need **versioned merges** within Python, use **jsonmerge**[1].
- If you need **true Git-like branching/versioning for in-memory JSON**, there is **no high-level Python library** available. You would need to either:
  - Serialize your data and use Git/lakeFS externally.
  - Build a custom solution (not recommended per LIBRARY_FIRST_RULE.md).

**Please clarify your exact use case:**
- Is your JSON data stored as files, or in-memory Python objects?
- Do you need full Git semantics (branching, merging, rebasing), or just versioned history?
- Are you open to using external services (lakeFS), or do you require a pure Python library?

With this context, I can recommend the most appropriate library or provide evidence that no suitable library exists.
