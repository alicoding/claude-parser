**Query:** python VS Code extension development library toolkit API

**Response:**

To develop a **Python-related Visual Studio Code extension**, the recommended approach is to use the official VS Code Extension API (which is JavaScript/TypeScript-based) together with the specialized Python extension template and supporting libraries. There is no pure-Python API for VS Code extension development; the standard workflow is to use TypeScript for the extension "frontend" and Python for any language server or backend logic.

**Key tools and libraries:**

- **VS Code Extension API**: The primary toolkit for extension development, written in TypeScript/JavaScript. It provides APIs for UI, commands, workspace, and more[4][5].
- **Python Extension Template**: A starter template for building Python tool integrations (linters, formatters, analyzers) as VS Code extensions. The extension part is in TypeScript, and the language server part (if needed) is in Python using pygls[3].
- **@vscode/python-extension npm module**: Provides types and helper utilities to access Python-specific APIs from your extension[3].
- **pygls**: A Python library for implementing Language Server Protocol (LSP) servers, used for language features like linting, formatting, and code analysis[3].

**Recommended workflow:**

1. **Start with the Python extension template**:
   - This template scaffolds both the TypeScript extension and the Python language server (using pygls)[3].
   - It provides glue code and examples for integrating your Python tool with VS Code.

2. **Use the VS Code Extension API**:
   - All UI, commands, and VS Code integration are handled in TypeScript using the official API[4][5].
   - You can expose APIs to other extensions or consume APIs from the Python extension using extension dependencies[4].

3. **Implement language features in Python (optional)**:
   - If your extension needs to provide language features (e.g., linting, formatting), implement a language server in Python using pygls[3].

**Example:**
- To build a Python linter extension:
  - Use the template to scaffold the extension.
  - Write the VS Code integration in TypeScript.
  - Implement the linter logic in Python using pygls.
  - Communicate between the extension and the language server via LSP.

**Summary Table:**

| Purpose                        | Library/Toolkit                | Language         |
|---------------------------------|-------------------------------|------------------|
| VS Code extension API           | vscode (npm package)          | TypeScript/JS    |
| Python extension integration    | @vscode/python-extension      | TypeScript/JS    |
| Language server (LSP)           | pygls                         | Python           |
| Extension template              | Python extension template     | TypeScript+Python|

If you have a specific functionality in mind (e.g., linter, formatter, AI integration), please specify so I can recommend the most appropriate library or toolkit for that use case.
