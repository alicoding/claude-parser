**Query:** framework for automatic project context analysis task enrichment codebase understanding semantic search AI development assistant tools that index codebases and provide context

**Response:**

Could you please provide more details? For instance, which specific tasks are you looking to support with this framework? Are you mainly interested in semantic search, code indexing, intelligent context analysis, or something else? Sharing details on the expected integration points and any file paths or error messages (if applicable) would help me recommend the most suitable libraries following our library-first approach.

Some high-level projects like Sourcegraph, Probe, and DeepGraph exist that index codebases and provide context through semantic search and context analysis, but I'd like to narrow down your requirements before suggesting a solution.

Could you please offer more context?

**Query:** I am building a task enforcement system that needs to: 1) Index entire codebase 2) Generate context for tasks (find similar code, libraries used, complexity) 3) Create success criteria based on project tools. Currently using LlamaIndex but want to know if there's a higher-level framework that already does ALL this - like Continue, Cursor, Aider, Mentat, or similar AI coding assistants that already have codebase indexing and context generation built-in

**Response:**

There are several higher-level frameworks and AI coding assistants that already provide **full codebase indexing, context generation, and task-aware enrichment**—often going well beyond what LlamaIndex offers out of the box. The most notable options, based on recent benchmarks and feature reviews, are:

| Tool            | Codebase Indexing | Context Generation (similar code, libraries, complexity) | Task/Success Criteria Awareness | Editor Integration | Agentic/Autonomous Actions | Notes |
|-----------------|------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------|--------------------|----------------------------|-------|
| **Sourcegraph Cody** | Yes (vector embeddings, code graph) | Yes (retrieves relevant files, understands code relationships) | Partial (can answer "how to use X", but not full task enforcement) | VS Code, JetBrains, more | Yes (multi-file, context-aware completions) | Best for large/monorepos; requires setup for private repos[1][5] |
| **Cursor**      | Yes (AI-native editor, auto-searches files) | Yes (navigates, refactors, finds similar code) | Partial (contextual, but not explicit task enforcement) | Own editor | Yes (agentic, multi-file refactor) | Large context window, agentic behavior[1][2] |
| **Augment Code**| Yes (deep workspace indexing, docs, deps) | Yes (finds similar code, libraries, complexity, project structure) | Yes (supports workspace rules, coding standards, project-specific preferences, can enforce guidelines) | VS Code, JetBrains, Vim/Neovim | Yes (plans tasks, runs commands, multi-file edits, reviews changes) | Enterprise features: compliance, rollback, multi-repo, agent-driven[3][4] |
| **Jolt**        | Yes (hybrid semantic search) | Yes (fast, accurate code search, finds relevant code for tasks) | Partial (focus on search, not full task enforcement) | Not specified | Not agentic | Fastest hybrid search for large codebases[2] |

**Key Insights:**

- **Sourcegraph Cody** and **Cursor** are the most mature for large-scale codebase indexing and context-aware code generation. Cody, in particular, builds a code graph and vector index, enabling it to answer deep context questions and generate code that fits your repo[1][5].
- **Augment Code** stands out for **task enforcement**: it not only indexes and generates context, but also supports workspace rules, coding standards, and project-specific success criteria. Its agent can plan, execute, and review multi-step tasks, making it the closest to a "task enforcement system" out of the box[3][4].
- **Jolt** is optimized for **hybrid semantic search**—very fast and accurate for code search, but less focused on agentic or enforcement workflows[2].

**Recommendation (per LIBRARY_FIRST_RULE.md):**
- If your priority is **task enforcement with context-aware enrichment and success criteria**, **Augment Code** is the highest-level framework that already does all of this. It deeply indexes your codebase, generates rich context (including similar code, libraries, and complexity), and supports agent-driven task execution with workspace rules and guidelines[3][4].
- If you only need codebase indexing and context for code generation (not explicit task enforcement), **Sourcegraph Cody** or **Cursor** are strong choices, with Cody being more flexible for integration into existing workflows[1][5].

**Example: Using Augment Code**
- Index your codebase (supports multi-repo, docs, dependencies).
- Define workspace rules and success criteria (coding standards, project-specific guidelines).
- Use the agent to plan and execute tasks, with context-aware suggestions and multi-file edits.
- Review changes with checkpoint-based rollback and compliance features[3][4].

**No need to build this from scratch**—these frameworks already solve the problem at a much higher level than LlamaIndex. If you need more details or integration examples for any of these tools, please specify your preferred editor, deployment model, or compliance requirements.

**Query:** Do Sourcegraph Cody, Augment Code, or similar tools have Python APIs or SDKs that I can call programmatically from my task-enforcer CLI tool? I need to integrate codebase indexing into ctask command line tool, not use their editors

**Response:**

**Yes, Sourcegraph Cody has an unofficial Python SDK (`codypy`) that allows you to programmatically interact with the Cody Agent—including codebase indexing and context-aware queries—from your own CLI tool, without using their editor integrations**[1]. Augment Code and similar enterprise tools do not currently offer public Python APIs or SDKs for direct programmatic integration; their workflows are primarily editor- or web-based.

### Sourcegraph Cody: Python API/SDK

- **codypy** ([GitHub: PriNova/codypy][1]) is a Python binding for the Cody Agent.
- You can:
  - Set your workspace path to your local repo.
  - Connect to the Cody Agent via Python.
  - Send/receive JSON-RPC messages for chat, context, and codebase queries.
  - Use as a CLI tool or import as a Python library.
- **Integration steps:**
  1. Download the Cody Agent binary and set `BINARY_PATH`.
  2. Set your Sourcegraph API token in `SRC_ACCESS_TOKEN`.
  3. Set `workspaceRootUri` to your repo.
  4. Use the Python API to send queries and receive context-rich responses.

**Example usage:**
```python
from codypy import CodyAgentClient

client = CodyAgentClient(
    binary_path="/path/to/cody-agent",
    src_access_token="your_token",
    workspace_root_uri="/path/to/your/repo"
)
client.connect()
response = client.send_message("Find similar code to this function...")
print(response)
```
- You can also use `codypy-cli` for CLI integration[1].

### Augment Code & Others

- **Augment Code** does not currently provide a public Python SDK or API for direct programmatic access; its agent and context features are accessed via editor plugins or web UI.
- **Cursor, Jolt, etc.**: No public Python SDKs for backend integration as of now.

### Summary Table

| Tool                | Python API/SDK | CLI Integration | Editor/Web Only |
|---------------------|:--------------:|:---------------:|:---------------:|
| Sourcegraph Cody    |      Yes¹      |      Yes¹       |      Yes        |
| Augment Code        |      No        |      No         |      Yes        |
| Cursor              |      No        |      No         |      Yes        |
| Jolt                |      No        |      No         |      Yes        |

**Recommendation:**  
For your `ctask` CLI tool, use the [codypy][1] Python SDK to integrate Sourcegraph Cody’s codebase indexing and context features directly into your workflow.

If you need more details or sample code for specific tasks (e.g., finding similar code, extracting libraries, complexity analysis), please specify your requirements.

---

**Recommendation (per LIBRARY_FIRST_RULE.md):**
- For **codebase understanding and code graph/AST/dependency analysis with high-level APIs**, use **Jedi**, **Rope**, or **LibCST** for open-source, Python-native solutions.
- For **enterprise-scale, AI-driven analysis** (including code graph and complexity), consider **Smart TS XL**[2].
- For **security and compliance**, use **Jit** or **Semgrep**[1][2].

If you need **batch processing** or **project-wide analysis**, combine these with **more-itertools** for batching and **pendulum** for date handling, per your codebase standards.

If you have a specific analysis task (e.g., "find all usages of a function," "extract dependency graph," "analyze code complexity"), please specify, and I can recommend the most direct library and example usage.
