**Query:** python dependency injection testing DRY violations automated fix

**Response:**

To automate fixing DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) violations in Python dependency injection testing, you should use a high-level dependency injection library that minimizes boilerplate and supports test overrides, rather than writing custom code or manual patching. The most robust and widely used library for this in Python is **python-dependency-injector**[5].

**Recommended Library:**
- **python-dependency-injector**: This library provides a declarative, container-based approach to dependency injection. It allows you to define dependencies once and override them easily in tests, eliminating repetitive setup and manual injection code[5].

**How it solves DRY violations:**
- Centralizes dependency definitions in containers.
- Enables easy test overrides without monkey-patching or repeated constructor arguments.
- Supports configuration, wiring, and test-specific providers, so you avoid copy-pasting setup logic across tests[5].

**Example: Automated DRY Fix in Tests**

Suppose you have a service that depends on a repository:

```python
# services.py
class UserService:
    def __init__(self, repo):
        self.repo = repo
    def get_user(self, user_id):
        return self.repo.fetch(user_id)
```

**Without DI library (DRY violation):**
You might repeat mock setup in every test:

```python
def test_get_user_returns_user():
    mock_repo = Mock()
    mock_repo.fetch.return_value = User(id=1)
    service = UserService(mock_repo)
    assert service.get_user(1).id == 1
```

**With python-dependency-injector (DRY fix):**

```python
from dependency_injector import containers, providers

class Container(containers.DeclarativeContainer):
    repo = providers.Factory(RealRepo)
    user_service = providers.Factory(UserService, repo=repo)

# In production
container = Container()
service = container.user_service()

# In tests (override only once)
def test_get_user_returns_user(container):
    container.repo.override(providers.Factory(MockRepo))
    service = container.user_service()
    assert service.get_user(1).id == 1
```
You define the override once per test module or fixture, not per test, eliminating repetition[5].

**Other Libraries:**
- **dry-auto_inject** (from dry-rb, Ruby-inspired): Moves dependency construction out of initializers, but is less common in Python[2].
- **returns**: For functional-style dependency/context management, but not a full DI container[4].

**Summary Table:**

| Library                      | DRY Violation Fix | Test Override Support | Declarative API | Pythonic |
|------------------------------|-------------------|----------------------|-----------------|----------|
| python-dependency-injector   | Yes               | Yes                  | Yes             | Yes      |
| dry-auto_inject (dry-rb)     | Partial           | Partial              | Yes             | No       |
| returns                      | Partial           | No                   | Yes             | Yes      |

**Next Steps:**
- Use **python-dependency-injector** for all dependency management and test overrides.
- Refactor test setup to use container overrides instead of manual injection or monkey-patching.
- Avoid custom DI code—let the library handle all wiring and test configuration.

If you need a concrete migration plan or have a specific codebase structure, please provide:
- Example of your current test setup
- How dependencies are injected now
- Any specific DRY violations you want to target

This will allow for a more tailored, library-first solution.

**Query:** python architectural test failure patterns missing imports DDD value objects

**Response:**

The most common architectural test failure patterns in Python Domain-Driven Design (DDD) projects—especially with **Value Objects**—are related to **missing imports**, improper dependency wiring, and lack of enforcement of DDD boundaries. These failures often stem from manual dependency injection, scattered configuration, or missing composition roots, leading to brittle tests and accidental coupling[3][2].

**Key Failure Patterns:**

- **Missing Imports:**  
  Value Objects or domain modules are not imported in test or bootstrap scripts, causing `ImportError` or `ModuleNotFoundError` at runtime. This often happens when tests or entrypoints are manually wired and a new Value Object is added but not registered everywhere it’s needed[3].

- **Manual Dependency Wiring:**  
  When dependencies (like repositories, unit of work, or value objects) are manually injected in each test or entrypoint, it’s easy to forget a required import or to wire a fake/real implementation inconsistently. This leads to duplicated code and missed dependencies, especially as the codebase grows[3][2].

- **Composition Root Omissions:**  
  In DDD, the *composition root* (bootstrap script) is responsible for assembling the object graph. If a Value Object or service is not registered here, tests and runtime code may fail due to missing dependencies. This is a common source of architectural test failures[3].

- **SRP Violations in Message Bus/Handlers:**  
  If the message bus or command handlers are responsible for creating or passing dependencies, this violates the Single Responsibility Principle and increases the risk of missing imports or misconfigured dependencies[3].

**Automated Fixes and Best Practices:**

- **Use a DI Container:**  
  Adopt a library like **python-dependency-injector** to centralize dependency registration and wiring. This ensures all imports are declared in one place (the container or composition root), and tests can override dependencies without manual patching[2][3].

- **Automated Architectural Tests:**  
  Use static analysis tools (e.g., pylint, flake8, or custom AST checks) to enforce import and registration rules. For example, you can write a test that asserts all Value Objects are imported and registered in the DI container or composition root.

- **Test Bootstrappers:**  
  Create separate bootstrap scripts for tests and production. The test bootstrapper should import and register all fakes/mocks, ensuring no missing imports for Value Objects or services[3].

**Example: Bootstrapper Pattern for DDD Value Objects**

```python
# bootstrap.py (composition root)
from myapp.domain.value_objects import Money, Address
from myapp.infrastructure.repositories import SqlAlchemyRepo
from dependency_injector import containers, providers

class Container(containers.DeclarativeContainer):
    money = providers.Factory(Money)
    address = providers.Factory(Address)
    repo = providers.Factory(SqlAlchemyRepo)
    # ... register all value objects and services

container = Container()
```
Tests can then override providers as needed, and static checks can verify all domain objects are registered.

**Summary Table:**

| Failure Pattern                | Cause                                   | Automated Fix/Best Practice                |
|-------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| Missing imports                | Manual wiring, scattered config         | Centralize in DI container/bootstrapper    |
| Manual dependency wiring       | No DI container, per-test setup         | Use DI container, test bootstrappers       |
| Composition root omissions     | Not registering new Value Objects       | Static checks, enforce registration        |
| SRP violations in handlers     | Handlers create dependencies            | Handlers receive dependencies via DI       |

If you have a specific error message, test failure, or code sample, please provide it for a more targeted, library-first solution.
