To generate API documentation, you can follow these steps:

1. Document each module, function, and class in your codebase using docstrings that describe their purpose, parameters, and return values.
2. Utilize tools like Sphinx or MkDocs to automatically generate documentation from the docstrings.
3. Organize the documentation into sections based on the different components of your project, such as hooks, tokens, CLI commands, etc.
4. Include examples and usage scenarios to help users understand how to interact with the API.
5. Provide information on any configuration settings, environment variables, or dependencies required to use the API.

Additionally, you can install Sphinx using pip, navigate to the root directory of your project, initialize Sphinx, modify the `conf.py` file to include paths to your Python modules, write docstrings in reStructuredText format, use Sphinx directives like `autodoc` to generate documentation, run the Sphinx build command, and find the generated HTML documentation in the specified output directory. By customizing the generated documentation with additional details as needed, you can create comprehensive API documentation for your Python project.
