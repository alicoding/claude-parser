# Backlog Separation Implementation - COMPLETE ✅

## What We Built

### 1. Project-Aware ctask Script
- Auto-detects current project from directory
- Auto-tags all tasks with project (+claude-parser, +temporal-hooks, +shared)
- Filters task views to show only relevant tasks
- Prevents cross-project confusion

### 2. Global Configuration Updates
- Updated ~/.claude/CLAUDE.md with project filtering rules
- Enforces `dstask +project` instead of plain `dstask`
- Documents the "NEVER DO" anti-patterns

### 3. Clear Separation Strategy
```
~/.dstask/ (shared backlog)
    ├── Tasks tagged +claude-parser (visible only in claude-parser)
    ├── Tasks tagged +temporal-hooks (visible only in temporal-hooks)
    └── Tasks tagged +shared (visible in both)
```

## How It Works

### For Claude-Parser:
```bash
cd /Volumes/AliDev/ai-projects/claude-parser
ctask show                    # Shows ONLY claude-parser + shared tasks
ctask add "Parser feature"    # Auto-tagged +claude-parser
ctask start 84               # Works on parser task
```

### For Temporal-Hooks:
```bash
cd /Volumes/AliDev/ai-projects/temporal-hooks
ctask show                    # Shows ONLY temporal-hooks + shared tasks
ctask add "Workflow feature"  # Auto-tagged +temporal-hooks
ctask start 92               # Works on temporal task
```

### Shared Tasks:
```bash
# From either project:
dstask add "Update task-enforcer" +shared
# Both projects can see and work on it
```

## Benefits Achieved

1. **Zero Confusion**: Each Claude sees only relevant tasks
2. **No Accidents**: Can't accidentally work on wrong project
3. **Shared Visibility**: Both can collaborate on +shared tasks
4. **Auto-Enforcement**: ctask handles tagging automatically
5. **Single Source of Truth**: Still using one ~/.dstask backlog

## Testing Results

✅ ctask correctly detects claude-parser project
✅ ctask auto-tags task 84 with +claude-parser
✅ ctask show filters to show only project tasks
✅ Task creation generates full enforced context
✅ Global CLAUDE.md updated with filtering rules

## Next Steps

1. **Copy HANDOFF_MESSAGE.md** to temporal-hooks Claude
2. **They update their ctask** with same project detection
3. **Both projects work independently** without confusion
4. **Shared tasks** enable collaboration when needed

## The Key Insight

We don't need separate backlogs or complex synchronization. Simple project tags (+claude-parser, +temporal-hooks, +shared) combined with the ctask wrapper completely solve the confusion problem while maintaining all benefits of a unified task system.

This is the "Reddit-worthy" simplicity we were aiming for!
