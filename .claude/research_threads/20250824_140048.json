      "content": "For **automatic DRY violation and duplicate code detection in Python**, the highest-level, most widely used libraries are:\n\n- **SonarQube** (with Python plugin)\n- **PMD's Copy/Paste Detector (CPD)**\n- **IntelliJ IDEA's Duplicate Code Detection** (if using the IDE)\n\nThese tools are specifically designed to detect **duplicate code, similar functions, and DRY violations** in Python and other languages.\n\n---\n\n### Recommended Libraries/Tools\n\n| Tool/Library                | Python Support | How It Works                        | Usage Level         |\n|-----------------------------|---------------|-------------------------------------|---------------------|\n| **SonarQube**               | Yes           | Scans for code duplication, DRY, and many other code quality issues. Integrates with CI/CD. | Enterprise/Team     |\n| **PMD CPD**                 | Yes           | Detects copy-paste/duplicate code via CLI or plugins. Supports Python. | CLI/Automation      |\n| **IntelliJ IDEA**           | Yes           | Real-time and manual duplicate detection in IDE. | Developer/IDE       |\n\n---\n\n### Details & Usage\n\n- **SonarQube**  \n  - Scans Python code for **duplicate code blocks, similar functions, and DRY violations** as part of its static analysis[5].\n  - Provides detailed reports and integrates with CI/CD pipelines.\n  - Requires setup of a SonarQube server and Python plugin.\n\n- **PMD CPD (Copy/Paste Detector)**\n  - Command-line tool that detects **duplicate code** in Python and many other languages[4].\n  - Example usage:\n    ```bash\n    # Install PMD (Java required), then run:\n    run.sh cpd --minimum-tokens 50 --files /path/to/python/code --language python\n    ```\n  - Outputs a report of duplicate code blocks.\n\n- **IntelliJ IDEA Duplicate Code Detection**\n  - If you use IntelliJ IDEA (Ultimate), it provides **real-time and manual duplicate code detection** for Python[2].\n  - Highlights duplicates as you type or on demand.\n  - Suggests refactoring options directly in the IDE.\n\n---\n\n### Other Mentions\n\n- **PyCharm** (by JetBrains, similar to IntelliJ) also has duplicate code detection for Python.\n- **SonarCloud** (cloud version of SonarQube) offers similar features for open-source projects.\n\n---\n\n**No need to write custom code** for DRY/duplicate detection‚Äîthese tools are mature, widely used, and integrate easily into Python workflows.  \nIf you need **CLI-only, open-source, and Python-specific**, start with **PMD CPD**.  \nFor **enterprise/CI/CD integration**, use **SonarQube**.\n\nWould you like a step-by-step example for integrating one of these tools into your workflow? If so, please specify your environment (CLI, IDE, CI/CD, etc.) and any constraints."

      "content": "**None of the following libraries‚Äî**pylint, flake8, vulture, radon**‚Äîdetect duplicate code or clone functions out-of-the-box.** They are static analysis tools focused on style, errors, complexity, and dead code, but **do not perform clone detection or DRY violation analysis**[3][5][2][4][1].\n\n---\n\n### What Each Tool Does\n\n- **pylint**: Checks for syntax errors, style violations, unused variables/imports, and code smells. No duplicate code detection[5][3].\n- **flake8**: Bundles Pyflakes, pycodestyle, and mccabe for style, error, and complexity checks. No clone detection[2][3].\n- **vulture**: Finds unused code (dead code), not duplicates[3][4].\n- **radon**: Measures code complexity and maintainability, not duplication[3][4].\n- **Pylama/Prospector**: Aggregate multiple linters, but do not add clone detection[3][4].\n\n---\n\n### For **Duplicate Code / Clone Detection** in Python\n\nYou need a **dedicated clone detection tool**. The most common and pip-installable options are:\n\n- **jscpd** (JavaScript Copy/Paste Detector, supports Python)\n    - Install:  \n      ```bash\n      pip install jscpd\n      ```\n    - Usage:  \n      ```bash\n      jscpd --languages python --path ./your_project\n      ```\n    - Detects **duplicate code blocks, similar functions, and copy-paste violations**.\n\n- **PMD CPD** (Copy/Paste Detector, Java-based but supports Python)\n    - Not pip-installable; requires Java.\n    - CLI usage for Python projects.\n\n- **SonarQube/SonarCloud**: Enterprise-grade, not pip-installable, but supports Python and clone detection.\n\n---\n\n### Summary Table\n\n| Tool      | pip install | Duplicate/Clone Detection | Main Purpose                |\n|-----------|-------------|--------------------------|-----------------------------|\n| pylint    | Yes         | No                       | Style, errors, code smells  |\n| flake8    | Yes         | No                       | Style, errors, complexity   |\n| vulture   | Yes         | No                       | Dead code                   |\n| radon     | Yes         | No                       | Complexity, maintainability |\n| **jscpd** | Yes         | **Yes**                  | **Duplicate code detection**|\n| PMD CPD   | No          | Yes                      | Duplicate code detection    |\n\n---\n\n**Recommendation:**  \nFor **automatic DRY violation and duplicate code detection in Python**, use **jscpd**‚Äîit is pip-installable, CLI-friendly, and specifically designed for this purpose.\n\nWould you like a sample configuration or usage example for jscpd?"
