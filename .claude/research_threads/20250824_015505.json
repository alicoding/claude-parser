      "content": "To detect **coding style patterns** in Python using machine learning and clustering, you should use high-level libraries that handle feature extraction, clustering, and code analysis, minimizing custom code per the LIBRARY_FIRST_RULE.md.\n\nBefore proceeding, please clarify:\n- Are you trying to cluster code snippets by **style** (e.g., PEP8 compliance, variable naming, formatting)?\n- Do you have a dataset of code samples, or do you need to extract them from a codebase?\n- What is your end goal: visualization, automated style enforcement, or something else?\n- Do you want to detect \"code smells\" (anti-patterns) or just stylistic similarity?\n\nAssuming you want to cluster Python code samples by **coding style** (not just code smells or quality), here’s the library-first approach:\n\n---\n\n## 1. Feature Extraction from Python Code\n\nUse **Radon** or **Pyanalyze** to extract code metrics and style features (e.g., cyclomatic complexity, line length, naming conventions). These tools provide programmatic APIs for extracting features relevant to style and structure[1].\n\n- **Radon**: Extracts metrics like cyclomatic complexity, raw metrics, maintainability index.\n- **Pyanalyze**: Static analysis for code style and type issues.\n\nExample (Radon):\n\n```python\nfrom radon.complexity import cc_visit\nfrom radon.metrics import mi_visit, h_visit\n\ncode = '''\ndef foo(x):\n    if x > 0:\n        return x\n    else:\n        return -x\n'''\n\n# Cyclomatic complexity\ncc = cc_visit(code)\n# Maintainability index\nmi = mi_visit(code, True)\n# Halstead metrics\nh = h_visit(code)\n```\n\n## 2. Vectorization\n\nConvert extracted metrics into feature vectors for clustering. Use **pandas** for tabular data manipulation.\n\n## 3. Clustering\n\nUse **scikit-learn** for clustering algorithms (e.g., KMeans, MeanShift, AgglomerativeClustering)[2][4].\n\nExample (KMeans):\n\n```python\nfrom sklearn.cluster import KMeans\nimport numpy as np\n\n# X: your feature matrix from code metrics\nkmeans = KMeans(n_clusters=3, random_state=42)\nlabels = kmeans.fit_predict(X)\n```\n\n## 4. Visualization (Optional)\n\nUse **matplotlib** or **seaborn** to visualize clusters.\n\n---\n\n### Summary Table\n\n| Step                | Library (Use This)      | Purpose                                 |\n|---------------------|------------------------|-----------------------------------------|\n| Feature Extraction  | radon, pyanalyze       | Extract code metrics/style features     |\n| Data Handling       | pandas                 | Organize features into vectors          |\n| Clustering          | scikit-learn           | Cluster code samples by style           |\n| Visualization       | matplotlib, seaborn    | Visualize clusters                      |\n\n---\n\n**Do not** write custom parsers or clustering code—these libraries cover 95%+ of the workflow. If you need to detect specific \"code smells\" (e.g., Large Class, Long Method), use the Radon API and label accordingly[1].\n\nIf you clarify your dataset and target style features, I can provide a minimal, library-first code example tailored to your use case."
