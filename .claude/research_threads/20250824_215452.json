      "content": "The error **TypeError: Parameter.make_metavar() missing 1 required positional argument: 'ctx'** occurs due to an incompatibility between certain versions of **Typer** and **Click**, especially when using **Python 3.13**[1][3]. This is a known issue when Typer is used with Click version 8.2.0 or higher and Typer versions before 0.16.0[1][2][3].\n\n**Key points:**\n- **Typer < 0.16.0** is not compatible with **Click >= 8.2.0**. The `make_metavar` method signature changed in Click 8.2.0, causing Typer to call it incorrectly, which leads to the TypeError[1][2][3].\n- **Python 3.13** support was added in Typer 0.16.0, which also introduced compatibility with Click >= 8.2.0[2].\n- The Typer documentation explicitly states that for Typer 0.15.x, Click must be pinned to a version **< 8.2**[2].\n\n**Solution:**\n- **Upgrade Typer to at least 0.16.0** to ensure compatibility with Click >= 8.2.0 and Python 3.13[2].\n- Alternatively, if you must use Typer < 0.16.0, **downgrade Click to < 8.2.0**[2].\n\n**Example fix (in your requirements.txt or pyproject.toml):**\n```\ntyper>=0.16.0\nclick>=8.2.0\n```\nor, if you cannot upgrade Typer:\n```\ntyper==0.15.3\nclick<8.2.0\n```\n\n**Summary Table:**\n\n| Typer Version | Click Version      | Python 3.13 Support | Compatible? |\n|---------------|-------------------|---------------------|-------------|\n| <0.16.0       | <8.2.0            | No                  | Yes         |\n| <0.16.0       | >=8.2.0           | No                  | No (TypeError) |\n| >=0.16.0      | >=8.2.0           | Yes                 | Yes         |\n\n**References:**  \n- [1] GitHub issue confirming the error with Typer 0.15.3 + Click 8.2.0  \n- [2] Typer release notes: compatibility and version pinning  \n- [3] Example traceback with Python 3.13, Typer, and Click\n\nIf you need specific upgrade commands or have a particular environment (e.g., pip, conda), please provide details for tailored instructions."
