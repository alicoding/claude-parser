      "content": "To split 6 files over 150 lines of code (LOC), you should aim for each file to be logically organized, focused on a single responsibility, and ideally under 30 lines per file, unless there is a strong reason to group related logic together[5]. This approach improves maintainability, readability, and enables multiple developers to work in parallel[1][5].\n\n**Key guidelines for splitting code:**\n- **Keep files focused:** Each file should handle a distinct part of the functionality (e.g., separate files for models, utilities, configuration, etc.)[1][5].\n- **Limit file size:** A common guideline is to keep files under 200‚Äì300 LOC, but for your case, with 6 files and 150 LOC, aim for roughly 25 LOC per file[5].\n- **Use directory structure:** Organize files in folders if needed to reflect their roles and relationships[5].\n- **Leverage build tools:** If using a language or framework that supports it, use tools (like Webpack for JS) to bundle split files for deployment[3][5].\n\n**Benefits of this approach:**\n- **Easier navigation:** Smaller, focused files are easier to find and understand[1][5].\n- **Parallel development:** Multiple people can work on different files without conflicts[1].\n- **Better caching and performance:** In web projects, splitting code can improve caching and reduce load times[3].\n\n**Best practices:**\n- Analyze your code to find logical split points (e.g., by feature, component, or utility)[3].\n- Avoid splitting so much that files become too granular and hard to manage[5].\n- Use automated tools to monitor and enforce file size and structure if possible[3].\n\nIf you have a specific language, framework, or file types in mind, please provide more details so I can recommend the best high-level library or tool for splitting and managing your codebase, as required by the LIBRARY_FIRST_RULE.md."
