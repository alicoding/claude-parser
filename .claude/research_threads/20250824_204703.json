Before proceeding, I need clarification on:\n\n- What language(s) are these files written in? (e.g., Python, JavaScript, Java, etc.)\n- What is your current definition of \"compliance\"? (e.g., PEP8 for Python, ESLint rules for JS, custom company rules, etc.)\n- Are there any specific frameworks or tech stacks involved?\n- Do you have existing config files (e.g., .prettierrc, .eslintrc, pyproject.toml)?\n- Are there any files or patterns to exclude from cleanup?\n- Is this a one-time cleanup or should it be automated for CI/CD?\n\nPlease provide this context so I can recommend the most appropriate, library-first solution and example workflow. \n\nIf you have sample file paths or error messages from previous attempts, please share them as well."
