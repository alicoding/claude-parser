      "content": "For implementing **event sourcing** and **CQRS** in Python with support for an **event store**, **projections**, and **event replay**, the most established and feature-complete library is the eventsourcing library[3]. There are also other options with varying levels of maturity and focus.\n\n### Recommended Library\n\n**eventsourcing**  \n- A comprehensive Python library for event sourcing, supporting event stores, projections, and replaying events into projections[3].\n- Install with:  \n  ```bash\n  pip install eventsourcing\n  ```\n- Features:\n  - Event store abstraction (supports multiple backends)\n  - Projections (read models built from event streams)\n  - Event replay (rebuild projections from the event log)\n  - Snapshots, versioning, and more\n\n**Example: Basic Usage**\n```python\nfrom eventsourcing.domain import Aggregate, event\nfrom eventsourcing.application import Application\n\nclass MyAggregate(Aggregate):\n    @event('SomethingHappened')\n    def do_something(self, data):\n        self.data = data\n\napp = Application()\nagg = MyAggregate()\nagg.do_something('hello')\napp.save(agg)\n\n# Replaying events to rebuild state or projections\nfor event in app.event_store.iter_events(agg.id):\n    print(event)\n```\nSee the official documentation for advanced projection and replay patterns[3].\n\n---\n\n### Other Notable Libraries\n\n| Library | Event Store | Projections | Replay | Notes |\n|---------|-------------|-------------|--------|-------|\n| **eventsourcing**[3] | Yes | Yes | Yes | Most mature, production-ready |\n| **quintans/eventsourcing**[2] | Yes (MySQL, PostgreSQL, Mongo) | Yes | Yes | Explicit support for projection replay, event bus integration |\n| **aliseylaneh/Python-Eventsourcing-CQRS**[1] | Yes | Yes | Not explicit | DDD, CQRS, FastAPI-based, less mature |\n| **Diator**[5] | No (CQRS only) | No | No | CQRS abstraction, not event sourcing |\n\n- **quintans/eventsourcing** provides explicit support for event store, projections, and replay, with database and event bus integrations[2].\n- **aliseylaneh/Python-Eventsourcing-CQRS** is a FastAPI-based DDD/CQRS/event sourcing example, but less mature and not as feature-rich as eventsourcing[1].\n- **Diator** is a CQRS library, but does not provide event sourcing or event store functionality[5].\n\n---\n\n### Projection Replay\n\nBoth **eventsourcing**[3] and **quintans/eventsourcing**[2] support **replaying events** to rebuild projections:\n- In eventsourcing, you can iterate over the event store and rebuild your read models.\n- In quintans/eventsourcing, projection replay is a first-class feature, and you can rebuild projections from the beginning of the event log[2].\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nFor production-grade event sourcing and CQRS with event store, projections, and replay in Python, use the **eventsourcing** library[3]. If you need explicit event bus integration or want to explore alternatives, consider **quintans/eventsourcing**[2]. For CQRS only (without event sourcing), Diator is an option[5]."
