      "content": "There is no widely adopted, high-level Python library that provides a full-featured **Memento pattern** implementation with built-in **undo/redo and state history** management out of the box. Most Python solutions for undo/redo and state history are implemented manually using the Memento pattern, as described in design pattern tutorials and articles[1][3][5]. \n\n**Key points:**\n- The Memento pattern is commonly used for undo/redo by capturing and restoring object state snapshots[1][3][5].\n- Most Python codebases implement this pattern themselves, typically with three classes: **Originator** (the object whose state is saved), **Memento** (the snapshot), and **Caretaker** (manages the history stack)[1][3][5].\n- There is no standard, pip-installable library that abstracts this pattern for arbitrary Python objects.\n\n**What you should do:**\n- If you want undo/redo and state history for your Python objects, you will likely need to implement the Memento pattern yourself, using the standard approach:\n    - Store snapshots of state in a history stack (for undo) and a future stack (for redo)[1][4].\n    - Use serialization (e.g., with orjson) for deep copies if needed[3].\n- If you are working with a specific framework (e.g., GUI, data science, etc.), there may be framework-specific solutions. Please specify your use case for more targeted recommendations.\n\n**Example of manual implementation (from GeeksforGeeks):**\n```python\nclass Memento:\n    def __init__(self, state):\n        self._state = state\n\n    def get_state(self):\n        return self._state\n\nclass Originator:\n    def __init__(self, text):\n        self.text = text\n\n    def set_text(self, text):\n        self.text = text\n\n    def create_memento(self):\n        return Memento(self.text)\n\n    def restore_memento(self, memento):\n        self.text = memento.get_state()\n```\nThis is then managed by a caretaker that keeps the undo/redo stacks[1].\n\n**If you need a library:**\n- Please clarify your use case (e.g., GUI, data models, specific frameworks).\n- If you want a generic, reusable undo/redo state history manager for arbitrary Python objects, there is currently no high-level library that does this for you. You will need to implement the pattern as above, using orjson for serialization if deep copies are needed.\n\nWould you like a ready-to-use code template for this pattern, or are you looking for a library for a specific framework or domain? Please provide more details about your context or requirements."
