      "content": "The highest-level Python library for **Git-like branching and versioning of JSON data structures** is not a single, widely-adopted package, but several tools and approaches exist that partially address this need. For strict adherence to the LIBRARY_FIRST_RULE, here are the best options based on current search results:\n\n- **lakeFS** is an open-source system providing Git-like branching and versioning for data lakes, including JSON files, but it is designed for large-scale data and works outside Python as a service layer[4].\n- **jsonmerge** supports versioned merging of JSON documents, allowing you to keep a versioned list of changes, but does not provide full Git-like branching (e.g., branching, merging, rebasing) semantics[1].\n- **No Python library found that natively provides full Git-like branching/versioning for in-memory JSON structures.**\n\n### Details\n\n#### 1. **lakeFS**\n- **Purpose:** Git-like branching/versioning for data lakes (files, including JSON).\n- **Workflow:** You interact with lakeFS via its API or CLI, not as a pure Python library. It is ideal for large datasets, not for in-memory Python objects[4].\n- **Use Case:** If your JSON data is stored as files and you want to branch, merge, and version them like Git, lakeFS is the highest-level solution.\n\n#### 2. **jsonmerge**\n- **Purpose:** Merging and versioning JSON documents.\n- **Features:** Supports versioned merges, keeping a history of revisions within the JSON structure.\n- **Limitations:** Does not support branching, merging branches, or rebasing like Git. It is focused on merging and versioning, not full VCS semantics[1].\n- **Example:**\n  ```python\n  from jsonmerge import Merger\n\n  schema = {\n      \"properties\": {\n          \"foo\": {\n              \"type\": \"object\",\n              \"mergeStrategy\": \"version\",\n              \"mergeOptions\": {\"limit\": 5}\n          }\n      },\n      \"additionalProperties\": False\n  }\n  merger = Merger(schema)\n  rev1 = {'foo': {'greeting': 'Hello, World!'}}\n  rev2 = {'foo': {'greeting': 'Howdy, World!'}}\n  base = None\n  base = merger.merge(base, rev1, merge_options={'version': {'metadata': {'revision': 1}}})\n  base = merger.merge(base, rev2, merge_options={'version': {'metadata': {'revision': 2}}})\n  # base now contains a versioned list of changes\n  ```\n- **Best Fit:** If you only need versioned merges, not full branching.\n\n#### 3. **Other Approaches**\n- **No direct Python library** found for in-memory Git-like branching/versioning of JSON structures.\n- Some developers have built custom layers to serialize database records to JSON files and use Git for versioning and branching, but these are not open-source libraries and require significant custom code[2].\n\n### Next Steps\n\n- If your data is **file-based** and you want Git-like semantics, use **lakeFS**[4].\n- If you need **versioned merges** within Python, use **jsonmerge**[1].\n- If you need **true Git-like branching/versioning for in-memory JSON**, there is **no high-level Python library** available. You would need to either:\n  - Serialize your data and use Git/lakeFS externally.\n  - Build a custom solution (not recommended per LIBRARY_FIRST_RULE.md).\n\n**Please clarify your exact use case:**\n- Is your JSON data stored as files, or in-memory Python objects?\n- Do you need full Git semantics (branching, merging, rebasing), or just versioned history?\n- Are you open to using external services (lakeFS), or do you require a pure Python library?\n\nWith this context, I can recommend the most appropriate library or provide evidence that no suitable library exists."
