      "content": "To replace all loops with **toolz** functions, you must first identify the type of loop operation (map, filter, reduce, groupby, etc.), then use the corresponding high-level toolz function. This approach is required by your LIBRARY_FIRST_RULE.md: use library functions (like those in toolz) instead of writing custom loops.\n\nBefore proceeding, please provide:\n- Example(s) of the loops you want to replace (code snippets or file paths).\n- The specific data structures involved (lists, dicts, custom objects, etc.).\n- Any edge cases or performance requirements.\n\nWithout this, I can only give a general workflow:\n\n**General Workflow for Replacing Loops with toolz:**\n\n1. **Identify the loop pattern:**\n   - Mapping: transforming each element → use `toolz.map` or `toolz.curried.map`\n   - Filtering: selecting elements by condition → use `toolz.filter` or `toolz.curried.filter`\n   - Reducing: aggregating to a single value → use `toolz.reduce`\n   - Grouping: grouping by key → use `toolz.groupby`\n   - Flattening: flattening nested iterables → use `toolz.concat`, `toolz.concatv`, or `toolz.itertoolz.flatten`\n\n2. **Replace the loop with the toolz function:**\n   - For mapping:\n     ```python\n     from toolz import map\n     result = list(map(lambda x: x * 2, data))\n     ```\n   - For filtering:\n     ```python\n     from toolz import filter\n     result = list(filter(lambda x: x > 0, data))\n     ```\n   - For reducing:\n     ```python\n     from toolz import reduce\n     result = reduce(lambda acc, x: acc + x, data, 0)\n     ```\n   - For grouping:\n     ```python\n     from toolz import groupby\n     result = groupby(lambda x: x['category'], data)\n     ```\n   - For flattening:\n     ```python\n     from toolz.itertoolz import concat\n     result = list(concat(list_of_lists))\n     ```\n\n3. **Remove all explicit for/while loops** and replace with the above.\n\n**Important notes:**\n- Do not use list comprehensions or generator expressions if the rule is \"toolz only.\"\n- If you encounter a loop pattern not covered by toolz, document it and provide evidence (PyPI, GitHub, Stack Overflow) that toolz does not support it.\n\n**Next steps:**\n- Please paste a representative loop or describe your use case in detail.\n- If you have a codebase, specify file paths or function names.\n\nThis will allow me to recommend the exact toolz function and show the minimal glue code required, as mandated by your quality standards."
