      "content": "There is no widely adopted, high-level Python library that provides a full-featured **Memento pattern** implementation with **snapshot, undo/redo history**, and **serialization** (via pickle or dill) out of the box. Most available solutions are custom implementations or basic design pattern examples, not robust libraries[1][3][4][5].\n\n**Key points:**\n\n- The Memento pattern is commonly implemented manually in Python, with the Originator, Memento, and Caretaker roles clearly defined[1][3][4][5].\n- **Serialization** (using pickle or dill) is often used to capture deep snapshots of object state, but this is typically done directly, not via a dedicated memento/undo library[3][2].\n- There is no evidence of a mature, pip-installable library that combines all of: memento pattern, undo/redo history, and pluggable serialization (pickle/dill) as a single package.\n\n**Recommended approach (per LIBRARY_FIRST_RULE.md):**\n\n1. **For undo/redo history and state snapshots:**\n   - Use a general-purpose **state management** or **history tracking** library if available.\n   - No such high-level library is found in the search results.\n\n2. **For serialization:**\n   - Use **dill** for advanced serialization (supports more Python objects than pickle)[2].\n   - Use **pickle** for standard serialization.\n\n3. **For design pattern structure:**\n   - Implement the Memento pattern using standard Python classes, as shown in the examples[1][3][4][5].\n\n**If you need a library that provides:**\n- **Undo/redo history** for arbitrary Python objects\n- **Snapshotting** with serialization (pickle/dill)\n- **Memento pattern abstraction\n\nPlease clarify:**\n- What is the type of object/state you want to snapshot?\n- Do you require thread safety, persistence to disk, or just in-memory history?\n- Are you looking for integration with a specific framework (e.g., GUI, data science, etc.)?\n\n**If you want a code example using dill for snapshots in a Memento pattern, or want help searching PyPI/GitHub for any new libraries, please provide more details about your use case and requirements.**"
