      "content": "For **Python code analysis and transformation using abstract syntax trees (AST)**, the highest-level, most capable libraries are:\n\n- **astToolkit**: A modern, composable, type-safe toolkit for AST manipulation, analysis, transformation, and code generation. It provides a layered API for matching, transforming, and generating Python code, making complex transformations concise and robust[4].\n- **LibCST**: A concrete syntax tree library that allows parsing, modifying, and re-generating Python code with full fidelity, including comments and formatting[3].\n- **ast (standard library)**: The built-in Python module for parsing, analyzing, and transforming Python code at the AST level. It is lower-level and more manual than the above libraries[2][5].\n\nHere‚Äôs a comparison of the top options:\n\n| Library      | Level         | Transformation | Code Generation | Comments/Formatting | Type Safety | Example Use Case |\n|--------------|--------------|---------------|-----------------|--------------------|-------------|------------------|\n| **astToolkit** | High         | Yes           | Yes             | Yes                | Yes         | Change all multiplications to additions in code[4] |\n| **LibCST**     | High         | Yes           | Yes             | Yes                | Yes         | Refactor code while preserving formatting[3] |\n| **ast**        | Standard lib | Yes (manual)  | Yes (manual)    | No                 | No          | Basic AST analysis and transformation[2][5] |\n\n**Recommended: astToolkit or LibCST** for most code analysis/transformation tasks, as they provide high-level, declarative APIs and preserve code formatting.\n\n### Example: Using astToolkit for AST Transformation\n\n```python\nfrom astToolkit import Be, IfThis, Make, NodeChanger, Then\nimport ast\n\ncode = \"\"\"\ndef double(x):\n    return x * 2\n\"\"\"\n\ntree = ast.parse(code)\n\n# Find multiplication nodes and replace with addition\nfind_mult = Be.Mult\nchange_to_add = Then.replaceWith(ast.Add())\nNodeChanger(find_mult, change_to_add).visit(tree)\n\nprint(ast.unparse(tree))  # Output: def double(x): return x + x\n```\n[4]\n\n### Example: Using LibCST for Code Transformation\n\nLibCST provides a similar high-level API and preserves formatting and comments.\n\n### When to use each:\n\n- **astToolkit**: For type-safe, composable, and layered AST transformations and code generation[4].\n- **LibCST**: When you need to preserve formatting, comments, and want a robust, modern API[3].\n- **ast**: For simple, low-level AST analysis or when you want zero dependencies[2][5].\n\nIf you have a specific transformation or analysis task, please provide more details (e.g., code sample, desired transformation), and I can show the exact usage with the best library."
