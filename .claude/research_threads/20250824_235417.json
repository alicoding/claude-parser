      "content": "LlamaIndex supports **incremental indexing and document management** through its `refresh_ref_docs` method, which allows you to update only changed or new documents in an index without a full rebuild[2][3][5]. However, automatic detection of changed files and removal of deleted documents requires additional handling.\n\n**Key capabilities and workflow:**\n\n- **Incremental Updates & Upserts:**  \n  Use `refresh_ref_docs(documents)` to refresh the index with documents that have changed (same `doc_id` but different content) or to insert new documents not previously indexed[2][3][5].  \n  This method saves compute by only updating documents with changes in text or metadata, and returns a list of booleans indicating which documents were refreshed[2][3].\n\n- **Document Deletion:**  \n  `refresh_ref_docs` does **not** remove nodes for documents that have been deleted from your source files[1].  \n  You must manually identify deleted files and call `delete_ref_doc(doc_id, delete_from_docstore=True)` to remove them from the index[1].\n\n- **File Change Detection:**  \n  LlamaIndex does **not** natively watch the filesystem for changes.  \n  You need to implement your own logic to detect changed, new, or deleted files (e.g., by scanning file paths and comparing to indexed doc IDs)[1].\n\n- **Metadata-based Refresh:**  \n  You can refresh documents based on metadata (such as user ID or version) by passing documents with updated metadata to `refresh_ref_docs`[5].  \n  For versioning, include a `version` field in document metadata and filter queries accordingly[4].\n\n**Example workflow:**\n\n```python\nfrom llama_index.core import VectorStoreIndex, SimpleDirectoryReader\n\n# Load documents and assign unique doc_id (e.g., file path)\ndocuments = SimpleDirectoryReader(input_dir=\"data\", filename_as_id=True).load_data()\n\n# Refresh index with changed/new documents\nrefreshed = index.refresh_ref_docs(documents)\n\n# Remove deleted documents\ndoc_ids = [doc.get_doc_id() for doc in documents]\nfor path in index.docstore.get_all_ref_doc_info():\n    if path not in doc_ids:\n        index.delete_ref_doc(path, delete_from_docstore=True)\n```\n[1][3]\n\n**IngestionPipeline Integration:**  \nYou can use an IngestionPipeline to preprocess documents before indexing, but incremental updates and refreshes are managed at the index level using the above methods.\n\n**Summary Table:**\n\n| Feature                | Built-in Support | Manual Steps Required |\n|------------------------|------------------|----------------------|\n| Incremental indexing   | Yes (`refresh_ref_docs`) | No                 |\n| Upsert/update          | Yes              | No                   |\n| Detect changed files   | No               | Yes                  |\n| Remove deleted files   | No               | Yes                  |\n| Metadata/versioning    | Yes              | No                   |\n\n**Best Practices:**\n- Assign stable, unique `doc_id` (e.g., file path) to each document for reliable updates and deletions[1][3].\n- Implement your own file change detection logic to trigger refreshes and deletions.\n- Use metadata for versioning and filtering during queries[4][5].\n\nIf you need code examples for a specific pipeline or integration, please provide more details about your file structure, update triggers, or desired automation level."
