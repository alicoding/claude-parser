      "content": "The **dstask note command** is used to attach or edit a Markdown note for a task[1][5]. If this command is not working and you suspect **corrupted YAML files**, the most likely cause is a syntax or formatting error in the YAML files that dstask uses to store its data.\n\n**Key points:**\n- **dstask** stores task data (including notes) in files that may use YAML or similar structured formats[5].\n- **YAML files are sensitive to formatting**: common issues include using tabs instead of spaces, inconsistent indentation, or broken quotes[4].\n- **Corrupted YAML** can prevent dstask from reading or updating tasks, causing commands like note to fail.\n\n**Recommended steps:**\n\n1. **Identify the corrupted YAML file(s):**\n   - Check the directory where dstask stores its data (commonly `~/.dstask/` or a `.dstask/` folder in your project).\n   - Look for files with `.yaml` or `.yml` extensions.\n\n2. **Validate and repair YAML files:**\n   - Use an **online YAML parser** or linter to check for syntax errors[4].\n   - Copy the contents of each YAML file into the parser.\n   - Fix any errors reported (e.g., replace tabs with spaces, correct indentation, close any unclosed quotes)[4].\n\n3. **Restore from backup if needed:**\n   - If you use git with dstask (recommended), you can revert to a previous commit where the files were not corrupted.\n\n4. **Test dstask note command:**\n   - After fixing the YAML files, try running the note command again.\n\n**If you need more specific help:**\n- Please provide:\n  - The exact error message you see when running dstask note.\n  - The path to your dstask data directory.\n  - A sample of the corrupted YAML file (with sensitive info removed).\n\nThis will help identify the precise issue and recommend the best fix, in line with the LIBRARY_FIRST_RULE.md: always use the highest-level tool (in this case, a YAML linter/parser) before attempting manual fixes."
