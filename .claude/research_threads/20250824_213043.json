      "content": "To enforce **dynamic content updates and JSON file validation** in a Git pre-commit hook, the recommended approach is to use the **pre-commit** framework with specialized validation libraries, minimizing custom scripting and maximizing reliability[3][5]. This ensures that every commit automatically validates and updates JSON files according to your rules.\n\n**Request for context:**  \nTo provide a precise solution, please clarify:\n- What kind of \"dynamic content update\" do you need for JSON files? (e.g., auto-formatting, injecting values, schema validation, etc.)\n- Are you using Python, Node.js, or another language for your tooling?\n- Do you have existing validation rules or a schema for your JSON files?\n- Is this for a monorepo, frontend, backend, or another context?\n- Any specific libraries or tools you already use or want to avoid?\n\n**Library-first solution (per docs/LIBRARY_FIRST_RULE.md):**\n\nThe **pre-commit** framework is the highest-level library for Git hook management and supports:\n- **JSON validation** (syntax and schema)\n- **Auto-formatting** (using tools like jq, prettier, or custom scripts)\n- **Dynamic content updates** (via custom hooks or existing libraries)\n\n**Example workflow using pre-commit:**\n\n1. **Install pre-commit**  \n   ```bash\n   pip install pre-commit\n   pre-commit --version\n   ```\n\n2. **Create a `.pre-commit-config.yaml`**  \n   Example for JSON validation and formatting:\n   ```yaml\n   repos:\n     - repo: https://github.com/pre-commit/pre-commit-hooks\n       rev: v4.3.0\n       hooks:\n         - id: check-json\n         - id: trailing-whitespace\n         - id: end-of-file-fixer\n     - repo: https://github.com/pre-commit/mirrors-prettier\n       rev: v2.8.8\n       hooks:\n         - id: prettier\n           files: \\.json$\n   ```\n\n3. **Install the hooks**  \n   ```bash\n   pre-commit install\n   ```\n\n4. **(Optional) Add schema validation**  \n   Use [check-jsonschema](https://github.com/python-jsonschema/check-jsonschema) for enforcing JSON schemas:\n   ```yaml\n   - repo: https://github.com/python-jsonschema/check-jsonschema\n     rev: v0.21.0\n     hooks:\n       - id: check-jsonschema\n         args: [\"--schema\", \"schema.json\"]\n         files: \\.json$\n   ```\n\n**Key libraries (no custom code required):**\n- **pre-commit**: Manages hooks and runs checks automatically[3][5].\n- **pre-commit-hooks**: Includes ready-made JSON validation and formatting hooks[3].\n- **check-jsonschema**: Validates JSON files against schemas[5].\n- **prettier**: Formats JSON files for consistency[3].\n\n**Why not custom scripting?**  \nManual Bash/Python scripts (like the one in [1]) are discouraged per your strict library-first rule. The pre-commit ecosystem provides robust, declarative solutions with minimal glue code.\n\n**Next steps:**  \nPlease provide the details requested above so I can recommend the exact pre-commit configuration and libraries for your dynamic JSON update and validation workflow."
