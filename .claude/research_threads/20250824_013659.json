      "content": "To rebuild projection state from events in Python, the highest-level library is **eventsourcing** (PyPI: eventsourcing), which provides comprehensive support for event stores, projections, and replaying events to rebuild state[2]. This library is specifically designed for event sourcing patterns, allowing you to derive current state from an event stream and rebuild projections as needed.\n\n**Recommended Library:**  \n- **eventsourcing** (PyPI: eventsourcing)\n\n**Key Features:**\n- Stores all changes as a sequence of events.\n- Supports building and rebuilding projections from event streams.\n- Provides APIs for replaying events to reconstruct aggregate or projection state[2].\n- Handles consistency, performance, and developer experience.\n\n**Example Usage:**\n```python\nfrom eventsourcing.domain import Aggregate, event\nfrom eventsourcing.application import Application\n\nclass User(Aggregate):\n    @event('Registered')\n    def register(self, name):\n        self.name = name\n\napp = Application()\nuser = User.register(name=\"Alice\")\napp.save(user)\n\n# Rebuild projection by replaying events\nevents = app.event_store.iter_events(user.id)\nstate = None\nfor event in events:\n    state = User.mutate(state, event)\nprint(state.name)  # \"Alice\"\n```\nThis example shows how to replay events to rebuild the aggregate's state, which is the basis for projections[2].\n\n**Projection Rebuild Workflow:**\n- Create a new projection table or model.\n- Replay all events for each aggregate to compute the new state.\n- Save the rebuilt state to the new projection[1].\n\n**Alternative Libraries:**\n- **quintans/eventsourcing** (GitHub) also supports projections and rebuilding them by replaying events, but is less widely adopted than eventsourcing[1].\n\n**Summary Table:**\n\n| Library         | Projection Rebuild Support | API Level | Notes                        |\n|-----------------|---------------------------|-----------|------------------------------|\n| eventsourcing   | Yes                       | High      | Most popular, well-documented|\n| quintans/eventsourcing | Yes                | Medium    | Migration features planned   |\n\n**Next Steps:**  \nIf you need a specific example for your domain, or integration with a particular database or framework, please provide more details (e.g., event schema, projection type, database backend). This will help tailor the solution and ensure strict adherence to the LIBRARY_FIRST_RULE.md."
