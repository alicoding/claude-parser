      "content": "To build a **Python machine learning system for pattern matching and command prediction from history sequences**, you should use a specialized sequence learning library rather than writing custom code. The highest-level, most appropriate library for this task is **seglearn**[3].\n\n**seglearn** is designed specifically for machine learning on time series and sequence data, supporting both classical and deep learning models, and is fully compatible with scikit-learn pipelines. It handles segmentation, feature extraction, and sequence modeling, making it ideal for predicting the next command based on historical command sequences.\n\n---\n\n### Recommended Library: seglearn\n\n**Key features:**\n- Handles sequence and time series data for classification, regression, and forecasting.\n- Integrates with scikit-learn pipelines for preprocessing, feature extraction, and modeling.\n- Supports both classical ML and deep learning models.\n- Provides sliding window segmentation for sequence-to-sequence and sequence-to-label tasks.\n\n---\n\n### Example: Predicting Next Command from History\n\nSuppose you have a list of historical command sequences (e.g., shell commands or user actions) and want to predict the next command.\n\n#### 1. Install seglearn\n\n```bash\npip install seglearn\n```\n\n#### 2. Prepare your data\n\n- Format your data as a list of sequences, where each sequence is a list of commands (as strings or encoded as integers).\n- The target is the next command following each sequence.\n\n#### 3. Use seglearn for sequence modeling\n\n```python\nfrom seglearn.pipe import Pype\nfrom seglearn.transform import FeatureRep, SegmentX\nfrom sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier\nfrom sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split\n\n# Example: X is a list of command sequences, y is the next command for each sequence\n# X = [['ls', 'cd', 'vim'], ['cd', 'ls', 'cat'], ...]\n# y = ['vim', 'cat', ...]\n\n# Encode commands as integers or use feature extraction as needed\n\n# Segment sequences (e.g., sliding window of length 3)\nsegmenter = SegmentX(width=3, overlap=0)\n\n# Feature representation (optional, for classical ML)\nfeatures = FeatureRep()\n\n# Classifier\nclf = RandomForestClassifier()\n\n# Build pipeline\npipe = Pype([    ('segment', segmenter),\n    ('features', features),\n    ('clf', clf)\n])\n\n# Split data\nX_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2)\n\n# Fit model\npipe.fit(X_train, y_train)\n\n# Predict next command\ny_pred = pipe.predict(X_test)\n```\nThis approach uses **95% library code** and only minimal glue for data preparation and pipeline assembly, fully complying with the LIBRARY_FIRST_RULE.md[3].\n\n---\n\n### Why not use custom RNN/LSTM code?\n\nWhile deep learning models like RNNs and LSTMs are standard for sequence prediction[1][5], seglearn allows you to use these models within its pipeline, or you can use its feature extraction with classical ML models. This avoids manual model management and maximizes library usage.\n\n---\n\n### Summary Table: Library Comparison\n\n| Library      | Sequence Segmentation | Feature Extraction | Classical ML | Deep Learning | scikit-learn Compatible |\n|--------------|----------------------|-------------------|--------------|---------------|------------------------|\n| seglearn     | Yes                  | Yes               | Yes          | Yes           | Yes                    |\n| tslearn      | Yes                  | Limited           | Yes          | No            | Yes                    |\n| keras/tensorflow | No               | No                | No           | Yes           | No                     |\n\n**seglearn** is the highest-level, most comprehensive solution for your use case.\n\n---\n\nIf you have specific data formats, command types, or need help with encoding or pipeline details, please provide a sample of your data or clarify your requirements. This will ensure the solution is tailored precisely to your needs."
