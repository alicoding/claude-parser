      "content": "To create **shared extractors using toolz**, you should leverage toolz‚Äôs functional utilities to build reusable, composable data extraction functions. Toolz is a high-level functional programming library for Python, providing utilities for iterables, functions, and dictionaries[1].\n\nBefore proceeding, please clarify:\n- What is the structure of your data (e.g., dicts, lists, JSON, DataFrames)?\n- What specific fields or patterns do you want to extract?\n- Will these extractors be used in a pipeline, a Meltano project, or standalone scripts?\n- Do you have sample input/output or existing code?\n\nAssuming you want to build reusable extractors for Python dictionaries or similar data, here‚Äôs how you can proceed using toolz:\n\n## Step-by-Step: Creating Shared Extractors with toolz\n\n1. **Install toolz** (if not already installed):\n\n   ```bash\n   pip install toolz\n   ```\n\n2. **Import toolz utilities**:\n\n   ```python\n   from toolz import get_in, compose, curry\n   ```\n\n3. **Define shared extractor functions**:\n   - Use `get_in` for nested dictionary extraction.\n   - Use `compose` to chain transformations.\n   - Use `curry` to create partially-applied, reusable extractors.\n\n   Example: Extract nested fields from a dictionary\n\n   ```python\n   from toolz import get_in, compose, curry\n\n   # Shared extractor for a nested field\n   extract_user_email = curry(get_in)(['user', 'email'])\n\n   # Shared extractor with transformation\n   extract_upper_email = compose(str.upper, extract_user_email)\n\n   # Example usage\n   data = {'user': {'email': 'alice@example.com', 'id': 123}}\n   print(extract_user_email(data))      # Output: 'alice@example.com'\n   print(extract_upper_email(data))     # Output: 'ALICE@EXAMPLE.COM'\n   ```\n\n4. **Share and reuse extractors**:\n   - Place these extractor functions in a shared module (e.g., `extractors.py`).\n   - Import and use them across your codebase or pipeline.\n\n5. **Advanced: Compose multiple extractors**:\n   - Use `compose` to build complex extractors from simple ones.\n   - Use `map`, `filter`, or `pipe` for batch processing.\n\n   Example: Extract and process a list of records\n\n   ```python\n   from toolz import map\n\n   records = [       {'user': {'email': 'alice@example.com'}},\n       {'user': {'email': 'bob@example.com'}}\n   ]\n\n   emails = list(map(extract_user_email, records))\n   print(emails)  # ['alice@example.com', 'bob@example.com']\n   ```\n\n## Key toolz Functions for Extractors\n\n| Function      | Purpose                                 | Example Use Case                  |\n|---------------|-----------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|\n| get_in        | Extract nested values from dicts         | get_in(['a', 'b'], d)             |\n| compose       | Chain multiple functions                 | compose(f, g, h)(x)               |\n| curry         | Create partially-applied functions       | curry(get_in)(['a', 'b'])         |\n| map/filter    | Apply extractors to iterables            | map(extractor, data)              |\n\n## Next Steps\n\n- If you have a specific data structure or extraction logic, please provide a sample so I can tailor the extractor functions.\n- If you are integrating with a pipeline tool (like Meltano), clarify how extractors should be registered or invoked.\n\n**Summary:** Use toolz‚Äôs get_in, compose, and curry to build modular, reusable extractor functions for your data. Place these in a shared module for use across your project[1].\n\nIf you provide more context or sample data, I can give you a more targeted implementation."
