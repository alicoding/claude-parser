      "content": "To consolidate 3 Stats classes into a single UnifiedStats class, you must first clarify several critical details to ensure the solution is library-first, minimal in custom code, and meets your codebase‚Äôs standards:\n\n**Please provide:**\n- The names and file paths of the 3 Stats classes you want to consolidate.\n- The programming language and framework (e.g., Python, Django, etc.).\n- The main attributes and methods of each Stats class (or the code itself).\n- Any existing dependencies or libraries already in use for statistics or data modeling.\n- The desired interface and requirements for UnifiedStats (e.g., should it be a dataclass, support serialization, etc.).\n- Any constraints (e.g., must be compatible with pydantic, must support batch operations, etc.).\n\n**Why this is necessary:**  \nWithout this context, I cannot determine which high-level library (e.g., pydantic, attrs, dataclasses, marshmallow, or a statistics/dataframe library like pandas or polars) is best suited for consolidation, nor can I ensure compliance with your strict library-first rule.\n\n**Next steps:**  \nPlease reply with:\n- The code or a summary of the three Stats classes.\n- Any sample usage or tests.\n- Any specific requirements for UnifiedStats.\n\nOnce you provide this, I will:\n1. Identify the highest-level library that can unify the classes with minimal glue code.\n2. Provide a library-based consolidation approach with code examples.\n3. Ensure the solution is 95% library, 5% glue, per your requirements."
